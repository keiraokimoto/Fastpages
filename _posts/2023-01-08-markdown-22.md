# Perform Create Performance Task Scoring Blog

# Performance Task Description
| Row Number | Description of Task | 
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Explain the program's purpose, input, output, and how it functions. For example, a program may be used for practical things, like calculating taxes, or for entertainment, such as playing a video. |
| 2 | The program should show two code segments, one which shows that the data has been stored in a list or another collection type, and that the data in said list is used in the program. |
| 3 | The program needs to use the list in a way that shows how complexity can be managed. For example, having a list with a thousand items could be managed by using specific calls to find specific parts of the data. |
| 4 | One procedure with at least one parameter that, when changed, changes the functonality of the procedure. Another code segment shows how the procedure is called. |
| 5 | An algorithm is used in the code, and it includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. For example, a loop is used as iteration. |
| 6 | Two calls made to the procedure pass different arguments into the algorithm to execute, and the result of each call is identified. |

In summary, to exceed Collegeboard standards, I would need to use loops and different algorithms to create a procedure, and call that procedure. I would also need to use if/else statements, as well as dictionaries, lists, and other data collection/recall devices.
