#  MCQ Practice Corrections
Here are the corrections for my practice MCQ.

| Question Number | What I Answered | What I Got Wrong |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 12 | My answer was (A), onFloor1 AND callTo2 + onFloor2 AND callTo1, because I thought calling to floor 2 while the elevator is on 1 would get it to move. | It would be (B), because it uses 'OR' instead of 'AND', both commans are not required to be correct for the elevator to move. |
| 14 | My answer was (D), there is no possible value of A that will cause the circuit to be true. I thought that the false input would make the program false. | The answer would be (A), the input for A would be true, because the input of A would have to be true for the program to function correctly. |
| 17 | My answers were (A), and (B). I thought (B) would give the same end result as (A), because they both ended at result (true). | The answer would be (A) and (D), because it marks the results as false, which is the same as the original marking the answer as 'not true'. |
| 21 | My answer was (B), 6. I thought that the program would simply add the numbers and make the answer into 6. | The answer would be (D), an infinite loopm, because the program would actually go in an infinite loop, because the stopping condition cannot be met. |
| 27 | My answer was (C), because I thought the arrow would move in the right direction if n + 1 was used. | The answer would have been (D), because the n + 1 should have been added at the end of the cycle to get it to move in the right direction, not before the algorithm. |
| 28 | My answers were (B) and (C), because I thought these combinations would get the arrow to move in the correct direction. | My answers should have been (A) and (C), because A would have done much the same as (C), just in a slightly different format. |
| 30 | My answers were (A) and (C), where (C) was correct and (A) was not. I thought (A) was very similar to (C) in how it functioned, which is why I chose it. | My answers should have been (B) and (C), because (B) was very similar to (C), but called the function at the very end instead of the beginning. |
| 43 | My answer was (A), thought I'm not exactly sure why. | My answer should have been (C), as no simulation can take every single possible factor into account when running. |
