# Test Corrections 11/07
## Question 1
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Final Question 1.png)
In this question, I answered C because I assumed the '*' symbol was referring to putting the result to the power of 5, but the * symbol was actually meant to symbolize multiplication. That is why the answer would be D instead of C.

## Question 2

In this question, I selected B, which says that the code displays nothing if x is negative and false if otherwise. However, the answer would actually be C, because the code tells the variable x to display as nothing if the value of X is negative, because it has no code to tell the value to display as true or false.

## Question 11

For this question, I answered A because I assumed that the 'repeat until' command told the code that it needed to iterate through the entire list and compare each element to the others in the list. However, the answer is actually B, because it compares each element to the elements that follow it in the list. This is because it iterates through j/k + 1, which tells the code to do the element after the one that has just looped.

## Question 24

For this question, I answered C but the answer is actually A. This is because I miscalculated the binary and instead of binary 1101 being after 12, I put it before 12. Binary 1101 is supposed to be equivelent to 13, which comes after decimal 12.
## Question 32

In this question, you are supposed to change yourList into the string from myList after the code is run through, but I added both the lists together instead, so the answer would actually be A because this answer simply says that the result of yourList is the same as the data from myList.
