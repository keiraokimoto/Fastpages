#  Project Blog
I'm not 100% sure what these mean, so I will try my best. 

Each individual performs starts "pre-view" outline/write-up of materials required for College Board. 
| Number on Rubric | Category | For My Project | 
| -- | -- | --- |
| 1 | Program Purpose and Function | The program's main purpose is to provide recipes to the user for convenience. The program functions as a simple tool for calculating recipe portions as well. |
| 2 | Data Abstraction | My project will use an API for recipe storing, as well as lists to categorize and store recipes. |
| 3 | Managing Complexity | Lists will be used to store the recipe inputs, and what users may input into the portions. |
| 4 | Procedural Abstraction | The addRecipe procedure will be used to add recipes to the program (API), and the procedure portionCalc will be used to calculate how much of each ingredient is needed for the recipe, depending on user input. |
| 5 | Algorithm Implementation | My program will call each respective algorithm when commanded to by the buttons on the frontend page. |
| 6 | Testing | For testing, I will add recipes and use the calculator as normal, and ensure everything is functioning correctly on the backend. |

Describe portion of Project you will use for Create Performance task.
For the project, I will use the portion calculator and recipe adding/deleting system for the Create Performance task.

Describe code plan as it is required for CB.
As for the code plan, I intend to implement a backend using flask, and connecting it to the frontend, which will be the website. The backend will house the APIs necessary for the program to pull data from, and store/add data to. On the frontend, the algorithms and procedures will be housed and called through the use if input text boxes and buttons. (Not quite sure how to answer this again, I hope this is alright).

Consider what will be demonstrated in video, aka video plan.
As for the video of the program, I would show how the program works. First I would go to the top of the page to show the recipes, then I would click on a recipe to pull it up in the program. After the recipe has been pulled up, I would type in how many portions of the recipe I want, and then submit it to the program to calculate how much of each ingredient is needed. I will also demonstrate the frontend and backend create/delete commands, and explain that the delete command is not accessable in the frontend because I do not want users deleting the recipes on the website.
