#  Project Blog
I'm not 100% sure what these mean, so I will try my best. 

Each individual performs starts "pre-view" outline/write-up of materials required for College Board. 


Describe portion of Project you will use for Create Performance task.
For the project, I will use the portion calculator 

Describe code plan as it is required for CB.


Consider what will be demonstrated in video, aka video plan.
As for the video of the program, I would show how the program works. First I would go to the top of the page to show the recipes, then I would click on a recipe to pull it up in the program. After the recipe has been pulled up, I would type in how many portions of the recipe I want, and then submit it to the program to calculate how much of each ingredient is needed. I will also demonstrate the frontend and backend create/delete commands, and explain that the delete command is not accessable in the frontend because I do not want users deleting the recipes on the website.
