# College Board Program Design

## Program Purpose and Function
- Our program's purpose is to provide vocabulary for math (AP Calc and AP Statistics), as well as physics, and provide quizzes to test skills.
- The program's function will be to use dictionaries, inputs, and outputs, to show information.

## Data Abstraction
- Dictionaries can be used to store data; data can be backlogged using a 'console.log' command (or something similar).
- Lists/dictionaries can also be used for search functions (ie; if 'Statistics' is searched, a list of words related to 'Statistics' will be run, and those items will appear.

## Managing Complexity
- Multiple lists can be used to map data, and dictionaries can be used to map certain data to lists
- Ex: If a term for the name of a list is searched, it can bring up those terms, and when a term is clicked, a dictionary can direct to different links.
