# College Board Grading Exercise 3

## Submission 1:

| Row Number | My Score + Reasoning | College Board Score + Why I Would Change My Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1, the program functions as described. | 1, same reasoning, same score. |
| 2 | 1, data is stored in a list, named RPS. | 0, RPS list is named, but is not used in the code. |
| 3 | 1, list is named and it shows how the list is used to store data.| 0, the written response does not specify the purpose of the program to the overall program. |
| 4 | 1, there is a procedure and parameters that can be changed. | 0, the written response does not specify the purpose of the code to the overall program. |
| 5 | 1, a loop is used to create a looping procedure.| 1, same reasoning and same score. |
| 6 | 1, different calls are given to the procedure, and things change based on what is input. | 1, same reasoning, same score. |

## Submission 2:

| Row Number | My Score + Reasoning | College Board Score + Why I Would Change My Score|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1, clear description of program function/functionality. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 2 | 1, shows how the data has been stored in the list for re-usage later on.| 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 3 | 1, offers a list and offers an option to how else the program could be used without the list. | 1, same score, same reasoning.  |
| 4 | 1, shows the procedure and shows how the parameters can be manipulated to change the procedure. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 5 | 1, the program uses sequencing, iteration, and selection to create an output. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 6 | 1, two calls are made to the procedure, and the conditions being tested in each cell and the output is identified. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |

## Submission 3:

| Row Number | My Score + Reasoning | College Board Score + Why I Would Change My Score|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1, mentions the program's functionality. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 2 | 1, shows how data is stored in the stateList. | 0, the code does not show the data being utilized in the statelist. |
| 3 | 0, does not show how a list is used to store data in the program. | 0, same score, same reasoning. |
| 4 | 1, shows and describes a procedure the student developed.| 0,  shows a procedure, but does not correctly describe it. |
| 5 | 1, includes sequencing, selection, and iteration in a loop and how to recreate the program. | 0, same score, same reasoning. |
| 6 | 0, does not calls a procedure but does not have a changeable parameter specified. | 0, same score, same reasoning. |

## Submission 4:

| Row Number | My Score + Reasoning | College Board Score + Why I Would Change My Score|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1, shows the program and states what it is used for. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 2 | 1, shows how data has been stored for later use in the fishtypes list. | 1, same score, same reasoning.|
| 3 | 1, shows a list and uses it to show complexity by storing the fish caught data. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 4 | 1, includes a student developed procedure that can be changed. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 5 | 1, a program with procedure is shown, it has iteration, loops, sequencing, and etc. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 6 | 1, shows the procedures being used/called and changed. | 0, does not show the procedures being used, or changed. |
