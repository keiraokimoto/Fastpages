One of the projects I saw at Night at the Museum was from Jiya, Ananya, Noor, and Shruthi's group. Their project was a food-themed website, like my group, so I was curious as to how they created their project differently as compared to my group's. One of the features on the website was a recipe finder that could find recipes based on the input time of day and the cuisine type. It would pull up a link to a recipe based on that. There was also a quiz function, which allowed the user to select answers on a quiz, then submit them for a score and recipe based off that score. The score could also be input into a leaderboard by the user.

Some of the other projects I saw were from classes like 3D Animation and Ceramics. There were lots of interesting projects, and seeing other students make the projects I did when I was younger in 3D animation was fun. I really enjoyed the ceramic creations, because it's always fun to see what creative things people can do when they make 3D objects, since making things with clay can be difficult and time consuming.
