# College Board Grading Exercise

## Submission 1:
| Row Number | My Score + Reasoning | College Board Score + Why I Would Change My Score|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1, the program works as intended, calculating values based on the given triangle side length numbers.| 0, the program would not receive a 1 in this category because the written response does not describe the input nor output, nor specify the program's purpose. |
| 2 | 0, the program does not show that the inputs have been stored in a list. | 1, there are two code segments provided, and there is a list called 'sideIndex' in the program as well, with a correct response along with it.|
| 3 | 0, the program, nor does the written response, does not explain how the code manages the complexity of the program using lists or otherwise. | 0, same score, different reasoning; the use of the list does not manage the complexity, as it is inaccurate in the written response, which discusses why lists are beneficial to the program. |
| 4 | 1, there is more than one parameter that has an effect on how the prodecure is run, and a procedure is called. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 5 | 1, the algorithm being utilized contains sequences, selection, and iteration by manipulating the numbers given to produce results. | 1, same score, same reasoning, but could have added specifics regarding the iterative loop for variable i decreasing by 1 from A, B, or C. |
| 6 | 1, in the written response, two calls are made to the selected procedure which allows the program to create an output from the given inputs. | 1, same score, same reasoning, different arguments are called. |

## Submission 2:
| Row Number | My Score + Reasoning | College Board Score + Why I Would Change My Score|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1, the written response states the program's functionality, and the input and output are shown visually. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 2 | 1, there are two program segments provided, and a list is provided for data to be stored. | 1, same score, uses startGrid as the list. |
| 3 | 1, complexity is managed through a system of inputs being used to control the program. | 1, same score, stores 10,800 items in a list. 
| 4 | 1, two program code segments are used, one where different inputs affect the procedure's output and another where the procedure is called. | 1, same score, uses replaceList (procedure) with two parameters. |
| 5 | 1, the program has multiple steps which are explained in the written portion. | 1, same score, same reasoning, includes sequencing, selection with an if/else statement, and iteration with a repeating loop. |
| 6 | 1, there are different arguments passed into the code | 1, same score, same reasoning with inputs/outputs. |

Essentially, a program would need:
- Lists that log input data
- A loop
- More than one procedure that can be called
- A way to input something that changes what is output by the procedure
