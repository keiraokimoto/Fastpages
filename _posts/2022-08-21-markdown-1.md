# First Markdown Post
## Basic formatting

You can use *italics*, **bold**, `code font text`, and create [links](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). Here's a footnote [^1].

## Lists

Here's a list of countries I've been to:

- France
- Germany

And a numbered list of birds I've had:

1. Comet
1. Star

## Boxes and stuff

> This is a quotation

{% include alert.html text="You can include alert boxes" %}

...and...

{% include info.html text="You can include info boxes" %}

## Images

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/logo.png "fast.ai's logo")

## Code

Random code because why not

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints 'hello there'
print(hello there)
```

    2

Formatting text as shell commands:

```shell
echo "hello world"
./some_script.sh --option "value"
wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png
```

Formatting text as YAML:

```yaml
key: value
- another_key: "another value"
```
