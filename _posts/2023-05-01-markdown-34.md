# MCQ 6 Corrections
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/mcq6.png)

## Question 4
I selected D, but D is incorrect becauseintegers cannot add fractions or decimals together. The program is only able to use a specific amount of bits, and the sum that has been computed is higher than the value the program can represent with integers.

## Question 15
I chose C, but the answer is actually A. This is because the program will display the same value as the output in the same order, not the same number of values with different values. This is because the loop is very similar for both, just with a reverse in order.

## Question 18
I chose D, but D would move the robot forwards and to the upper right of the grid and then to the upper left of the grid, and off the edge of the grid, which would cause an error. The correct answer would be C because the robot is moved into the correct position.

## Question 22
I thought the answer would be B because B matched the amount of values, however the answer would be D because the remaining 3/4 of the code matches the 'else' statement.

## Question 34
The answer should have been C, because the answer I chose, B, moves the bot right back to where it started, making it rotate right and move (then repeat). This would not have gotten it to the original point.

## Question 55
The answer I chose was B, but this is wrong because it will cause the algorith to make the last person's card have the sum of the heights, and double the actual number of people at the bottom. The average height would be off because of this.

## Question 64
I chose B and C. B is correct, but C is not. This is because the procedure will add -2 to the result 5 times, which will make the end product -10.
