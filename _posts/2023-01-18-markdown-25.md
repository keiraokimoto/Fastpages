#  5.1 and 5.2 Blog Post

## 5.1 Blog Post Reflection
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing.

| Type of Computer Feature | Beneficial Effects | Harmful Effects |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Streaming Sites (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) | Easy to access videos, good entertainment, convenient hub for videos and movies | May cost money to get access, sometimes limits account usage, can be addicting or time consuming |
| Social Media (Twitter, Instagram, etc.) | Easy to connect with people from around the world, can get news quickly, fun to see what other people are doing | Can be addicting, can be harmful to your mental health and self esteem, people may bully you |
| Wiki websites (Wikipedia, Wikihow, etc.) | Good for finding 'how-tos', good source of information for essays, archieves information for future use | May have false information, can always be deleted, may be missing information if no one decides to add it |

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
While it does not affect me much personally, there are plenty of cases where people, especially teens, are harmed by the internet because of negative comments on them or their appearance. 

## 5.2 Blog Post Reflection â€“ Digital Empowerment
How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
A person can empower themselves in a digital world by taking steps to protect themselves from possible threats in the digital world. This can mean protecting your information and not posting it on the internet, or by using other services, such as a VPN, to protect your information. 

How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
Those who are empowered could help by guiding or protecting those who aren't. They could also teach those who aren't empowered to become empowered themselves. For example, I could teach someone how to program or to be more confident in themselves and their programming skills, if they believe they are not good at what they are doing. (Not quite sure if this was the right way to answer, but I tried my best).

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
Yes, things such as paper and red tape do block digital empowerment. Such barriers can be seen in financial differences, where a person cannot acquire a device or otherwise because of financial constraints. This is both prevelent in Del Norte, and outside of it, as this problem can be seen around the world.

## Other Questions
Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit.
Ease in finding recipes, calculating proportions, and being able to add recipes are all benefits of my project.

Think of a potential harmful effect of your project.
A harmful effect of my project could be that it could make users reliant on it for recipe information. (Not really sure if there are any downsides).

Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year:  What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school?
The pros of an internet blocker include making sure a person doesn't see something that is not appropriate for them to see, and keeps them from installing things that could harm a person's device or other devices at the school. One of the main cons is that these blockers also prevents students from accessing some resources, or installing/using software that they may need, especially in classes such as computer science.

What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide?  For yourself or for others.
Personally, I'm concerned with how the world will go forward. While those with devices are at an advantage, that often leaves people without access or the ability to purchase devices behind. Since devices are starting to become mandatory for purchases or even for education, it could place those without them at an extreme disadvantage. I'm not too worried about myself, but people without devices struggle a lot, and that is worrisome.
