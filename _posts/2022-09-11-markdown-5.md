# Planning for Applab Quiz

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Plan.png)

# AppLab Code Plan

- Page Order:
 - Start
 - Question 1
 - If correct -> Correct page
 - If incorrect -> Incorrect page
 - For both incorrect and correct pages: click continue, continues to next question (repeat until all questions are finished)
 - Endpage

- Dictionaries are added for storing keys/values, keys being the questions/page names and the values being the correct answers
- Dictionaries are added into functions, which change depending on the question (ie: Question1 will have the 'correct' value as 'button3', whereas Question2 will have the 'correct' value as 'ans1')
- A wrong answer will direct to the incorrect_page, which is the same page for every incorrect
- The same goes for correct answers, a correct answer will direct to the correct_page
- Both the incorrect and correct pages have a 'Continue' button, which will change to the next question (question1, then question2, then question3, and the endpage)
