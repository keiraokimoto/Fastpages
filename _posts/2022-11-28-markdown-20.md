# Unit 3.1 and 3.2
## Variables and Assignments Notes

I did my best. Ya'll were speedrunning I am NOT a speedrunner.

## Python:
Variables - Name/define; other functions can be done after naming
= - Will set something equal to something else, usually a word and number or list, etc
Functions can be performed when names are applied (it tells the function to apply to things with the same name)
Floats - Decimals that can be used to do math/whatever a function asks for
Dictionaries assign keys and values

## Javascript:
'var xyz' is a variable assignment (ie; variables can be assigned using var)
Booleen is true/false
Strings are words, such as 'let' 
Lists - const (name) =

# Data Abstraction:
- For APs, indexes start at 1 rather than 0

## Python:
- Lists look like: name = ["word", "word"]
- Lists are often used to store data
- Lists can also be used to make more lists by using the format: list = ["Strawberry - Fruit", "Brocolli - Vegetable"]
And add: fruit = [] and vegetable = []
Code such as 'for fruit in list' can be used to specify what the program is supposed to do with the items under this category in the list
- Split [split()] function can be used to split a string into a list
- Join [join()] method takes all items in an iterable and joins them into one string; a string must be specified as a seperator

## Javascript:
- this.(name) can be used to specify different types of data, (name) can be used to make a category for the data to go in
- data can be displayed using var (variable name) = [ new (variable name)("Name", "Date", "Age"), etc etc.];
- A function can be used afterwards to store the data, using:
         function (function name)(name, (variable name))
         name.setRole("Name");
         this.name = name;
         this.variable name = [Name];
             Etc., etc.
- To add into a pretty looking table that isn't ugly and gross:
(Sorry for the big code block I thought this was important)

.prototype._toHtml = function() { // display data in a table
    var style = (
        "display:inline-block;" +
        "border: 2px solid grey;" +
        "box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey;"
    );
    // set up the table

    var body = "";
    body += "<tr>";
    body += "<th><mark>" + "Name" + "</mark></th>";
    body += "<th><mark>" + "Position" + "</mark></th>";
    body += "<th><mark>" + "Batting Average" + "</mark></th>";
    body += "<th><mark>" + "Role" + "</mark></th>";
    body += "</tr>";
    
      // include the data in the table according to categories. 

    for (var row of sd2022.padres) {
        
        body += "<tr>";
        
        body += "<td>" + row.name + "</td>";
        body += "<td>" + row.position + "</td>";
        body += "<td>" + row.average + "</td>";
        body += "<td>" + row.role + "</td>";
        
        body += "<tr>";
      }
    
       // html format
      return (
        "<div style='" + style + "'>" +
          "<table>" +
            body +
          "</table>" +
        "</div>"
      );
    
    };
    
    
    $$.html(sd2022._toHtml());

A for loop will be run and this function will input the data in the table :)
