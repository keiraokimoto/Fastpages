# College Board Grading Exercise 2

## Submission 1:

| Row Number | My Score + Reasoning | College Board Score + Why I Would Change My Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1, the program functions as described. | 0, the written response does not address the program functionality. |
| 2 | 1, data is stored in a list (the code remembers what animal has been shown and marks it as correct/incorrect). | 0, animalList is named, but is not used in the code. |
| 3 | 1, list is named and it shows how the list is used to store data.| 0, the program does not include a code segment that uses a list. |
| 4 | 1, there is a procedure and parameters that can be changed. | 0, the written response does not include a description on how the program functonality contributes to the overall functionality. |
| 5 | 1, a loop is used to create a looping procedure.| 0, does not explain the algorithm in enough detail for it to be recreated. |
| 6 | 1, different calls are given to the procedure, and things change based on what is input. | 1, same reasoning. |

## Submission 2:

| Row Number | My Score + Reasoning | College Board Score + Why I Would Change My Score|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1, clear description of program function/functionality. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 2 | 1, shows how the data has been stored in the list for re-usage later on.| 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 3 | 1, offers a list and offers an option to how else the program could be used without the list. | 1, same score, same reasoning.  |
| 4 | 1, shows the procedure and shows how the parameters can be manipulated to change the procedure. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 5 | 1, the program uses sequencing, iteration, and selection to create an output. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 6 | 1, two calls are made to the procedure, and the conditions being tested in each cell and the output is identified. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |

## Submission 3:

| Row Number | My Score + Reasoning | College Board Score + Why I Would Change My Score|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 0, does not mention program's functionality. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 2 | 1, shows how data is stored in the characterList. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 3 | 1, shows how a list is used to store data in the program| 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 4 | 1, shows and describes a procedure the student developed.| 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 5 | 1, includes sequencing, selection, and iteration in a loop and how to recreate the program. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 6 | 1, calls a procedure and identifies results of each cell. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |

## Submission 4:

| Row Number | My Score + Reasoning | College Board Score + Why I Would Change My Score|
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1, shows the program and states what it is used for. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 2 | 2, shows how data has been stored for later use. | 0, stored data is not being used in the program later on.|
| 3 | 1, shows a list and uses it to show complexity. | 0, list is not used to show the program's complexity, though it is present.|
| 4 | 1, includes a student developed procedure that can be changed. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 5 | 1, a program with procedure is shown, it has iteration, loops, sequencing, and etc. | 1, same score, same reasoning. |
| 6 | 1, shows the procedures being used/called and changed. | 0, does not show the procedures being used, or changed. |
