<li>Simulations are used to simplify/modify certain variables</li>
<li>Simulations can contain bias</li>
<li>They can be used to simulate things as tests (ie, launching a bomb) when these actions are too dangerous/impractical to do in the real world </li>
<li>Simulations can also be used to create situations that are too difficult to recreate in the real world (specific weather conditions for example)</li>
<li>Random modules define series of objects that can be generated randomly</li>
<li>Randomization helps simulations, as they can help predict many varying probablilities of a simulation</li>
<li>Abstractions use conditionals to execute one part of the code only when a particular condition is met, repeat looping, simplification, and it does not request input from the user or display output to the user</li>
<li>It is far cheaper to create a simulation than to do said actions in real life</li>
</ul>
<p>erm hopefully thats enough notes i cant</p>

<li>A researcher gathers data about the effect of Advanced Placement®︎ classes on students' success in college and career, and develops a simulation to show how a sequence of AP classes affect a hypothetical student's pathway. Several school administrators are concerned that the simulation contains bias favoring high-income students, however.<ul>
<li>answer options:<ol>
<li>The simulation is an abstraction and therefore cannot contain any bias</li>
<li>The simulation may accidentally contain bias due to the exclusion of details.</li>
<li>If the simulation is found to contain bias, then it is not possible to remove the bias from the simulation.</li>
<li>The only way for the simulation to be biased is if the researcher intentionally used data that favored their desired output.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li>Jack is trying to plan his financial future using an online tool. The tool starts off by asking him to input details about his current finances and career. It then lets him choose different future scenarios, such as having children. For each scenario chosen, the tool does some calculations and outputs his projected savings at the ages of 35, 45, and 55.Would that be considered a simulation and why?<ul>
<li>answer options<ol>
<li>No, it's not a simulation because it does not include a visualization of the results.</li>
<li>No, it's not a simulation because it does not include all the details of his life history and the future financial environment.</li>
<li>Yes, it's a simulation because it runs on a computer and includes both user input and computed output.</li>
<li>Yes, it's a simulation because it is an abstraction of a real world scenario that enables the drawing of inferences.</li>

<li>Sylvia is an industrial engineer working for a sporting goods company. She is developing a baseball bat that can hit balls with higher accuracy and asks their software engineering team to develop a simulation to verify the design.Which of the following details is most important to include in this simulation?<ul>
<li>answer options<ol>
<li>Realistic sound effects based on the material of the baseball bat and the velocity of the hit</li>
<li>A depiction of an audience in the stands with lifelike behavior in response to hit accuracy</li>
<li>Accurate accounting for the effects of wind conditions on the movement of the ball</li>
<li>A baseball field that is textured to differentiate between the grass and the dirt</li>

<li>Ashlynn is an industrial engineer who is trying to design a safer parachute. She creates a computer simulation of the parachute opening at different heights and in different environmental conditions.What are advantages of running the simulation versus an actual experiment?<ul>
<li>answer options<ol>
<li>The simulation will not contain any bias that favors one body type over another, while an experiment will be biased.</li>
<li>The simulation can be run more safely than an actual experiment</li>
<li>The simulation will accurately predict the parachute's safety level, while an experiment may be inaccurate due to faulty experimental design.</li>
<li>The simulation can test the parachute design in a wide range of environmental conditions that may be difficult to reliably reproduce in an experiment.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Rinne Amagi wants to go to a casino, but Niki Shiina won't let him because he keeps wasting Niki's money, which is absolutely fair. He creates a computer simulation after much difficulty and suffering to gamble without Niki knowing, because he has an addiction. While his program is almost perfect, it lacks a good way to simulate a real casino, and the randomization is off. What are some things he could add to improve his simulation? (2 answers)<ul>
<li>Answer Options<ol>
<li>Niki Shiina dragging him out of the casino.</li>
<li>A randomization function, where each result has different chances to appear based on a percentage.</li>
<li>More items of different categories/ranks to make a bigger randomized simulation.</li>
<li>Throw his computer against a wall and cry because he's weak.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scaramouche has spent years trying to overthrow the Raiden Shogun, but to no avail. He is unfortunately the same element she is, and immunity is evil. He creates a simulation to determine what stance he should take to fight her, but thinks it's not close enough to reality. What could he add to his simulation to make it more realistic?<ul>
<li>Answer Options<ol>
<li>The Raiden Shogun's personal fox maiden.</li>
<li>He should take into account whether the Shogun is injured or not.</li>
<li>He should take the weather into account.</li>
<li>He should consider his life choices and have an existencial breakdown.</li>

[&#34;Rinne Amagi wants to go to a casino, but Niki Shiina won&#39;t let him because he keeps wasting Niki&#39;s money, which is absolutely fair. He creates a computer simulation after much difficulty and suffering to gamble without Niki knowing, because he has an addiction. While his program is almost perfect, it lacks a good way to simulate a real casino, and the randomization is off. What are some things he could add to improve his simulation? (2 answers)&#34;]

[&#34;A researcher gathers data about the effect of Advanced Placement classes on students&#39; success in college and career, and develops a simulation to show how a sequence of AP classes affect a hypothetical student&#39;s pathway. Several school administrators are concerned that the simulation contains bias favoring high-income students, however.&#34;]
