# Quiz Corrections (3/24)
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/mcquiz3.png)

## Question 11
I answered for the money made from food and drink sales, but the answer should have been average ticket price, because that accounts for each person who came to the concert. I honestly don't know why I answered this I may have missclicked or assumed that each person decided to get food, which would then present a good view on how many people actually attended the concert.

## Question 20
For this question, I selected A, but my answer should have been B. This is because the expression cannot be equal to both 'lo' and 'med' cannot be selected at the same time, and it would cause the expression to always be false. Therefore, it would have to be 'or' instead of 'and'.

## Question 21
I chose B and C for this question, and while B was correct, C was not. Instead of C, I should have selected D, because the sequence of steps does not remove any entries with an unknown year, so the entry in the first row of the spreadsheet will have a year value of -1, which would not allow the desired entry.
