# MCQ 5 Corrections

## Question 11
The answer would be D, not A. I thought the answer would be A because the spinner has 3 colors, so spinning it with these 3 colors in mind would produce the correct output. However, since there are actually 6 portions of the spinner, spinning it 6 times would give the correct proportions of the spinner, whereas 3 would only give 3 portions.

## Question 23
The answer would be B instead of C, because there are multiple paths from P to S, and the system must not have multiple paths if it is not supposed to work.

## Question 37
Both of the algorithms actually produce the correct output, however, the first code segment requires more math than the second code segment.

## Question 42
IPv6 actually has 2^96 addresses avaliable, not 96. This is because the number of addresses is based on powers, not the exact IP address amount.

## Question 46
The answer would be D instead of A, because it is not completely possible for an algorithm to be created that can solve for every single program and input, even if the language being used is a low-level programming language.

## Question 47
The recipient's private key would be used, instead of the sender's private key, because the sender is not sending their key to the recipient.

## Question 64
I answered C correctly, but D was incorrect. The answer should have been B, because cloud computing has not reduced concerns about intellectual property rights, as cloud computing cites need to protect their users' data.
