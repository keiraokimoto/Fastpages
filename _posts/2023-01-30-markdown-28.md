# Team Review Ticket

## Notes from Presentation:
- Slideshow with basic visuals
- Plans for features on  a slide
- Full stack features and designs
Examples of frontend:
- Info about features and usage of website
- Viewable database
- All pages should have cross compatibility
- Separate purpose and function
- Control flow for programs
- Flow charts of frontend and backend
- Timeline for development process
- Manifesto of development beliefs

## Part of my own notes/recollection of the presentations:
- Many groups did projects based around games or food, with one of the presentations being about a Cat Cafe website
- Some groups guided through the project's basic structure, some included frontend images and some did not
- Most groups did not go into backend details, although mine did
- One other group had a website very similar to my groups, as its subject matter was food
- However, their website was based on finding recipes for people looking for healthy food to eat, whereas ours was more generalized
- Many groups had their website structured or parodied off Cool Math Games, and each person in the group would be responsible for creating one game for the website
- Some groups linked their games together using a leaderboard, which would rank players based off the scores they received in the games they played.
