<ul>
  <li>Computers used to be very large, and take up full rooms because of how big they were</li>
  <li>Computers got smaller as time progressed</li>
  <li>Computers needed to connect to each other in order to work</li>
  <li>Routers were created to help computers work faster and connect to each other</li>
  <li>Routers also help information find its way from the sender to the receiver</li>
  <li>Packets are small amounts of data sent over a network, which include data, source information, and destination information</li>
  <li>Packets are sent by the sender and received by the receiver</li>
  <li>Computer systems are groups of computers working together to achieve a common goal</li>
  <li>Computer networks are a group of interconnected devices that send and receive data</li>
  <li>Packet switching is when a message/file is broken up into packets and sent in any order, then reassembled by the receiving device</li>
  <li>A path is the network between two computing devices, and is a sequence of directly connected computing devices</li>
  <li>Bandwidth (measured in bits per second (BPS)) is the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a fixed amount of time on a computer network</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) - The layers needed to go through to communicate (Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical)</li>
  <li>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - Establishes a common standard for how to send messages between devices on the internet (Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access)</li>
  <li>There are many different protocols, standards, and etc. used in the Application/Transport levels, such as HTTP and DNS (OSI layers 3-7)</li>
  <li>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) manages the development of internet standards via written technical discussions (Requests for Comments, RFC) in an open and collaborative process</li>
  <li>Network Access Layer:
    <ul>
      <li>Pulls the 1’s and 0’s from a wire or radio wave, focused on hardware and protocols that carry 1’s or 0’s</li>
      <li>Each NIC has a unique address associated with it (Media Access Control (MAC) Address), used for local hops</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Network Access/Internet Layer Data Transmission:
    <ul>
      <li>A packet contains data that is being transmitted as well as metadata containing iniformation used for routing information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Internet Layer:
    <ul>
      <li>Internet was designed to be scalable/able to change in size and scale to meet new demands</li>
      <li>Local Area Network (LAN) physically connects, limited by hardware and physics, 1 to hundreds of systems</li>
      <li>Intranet - LANs connected by routers within an organization, hundreds to thousands of systems</li>
      <li>Autonomous Systems (AS) - Large intranets linked together under the control and policies of major organizations, tens of thousands of systems</li>
      <li>The internet, millions of systems made of Autonomous Systems linked together</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Transport Layer:
    <ul>
      <li>TCP does error checking and error recovery, so it is slower</li>
      <li>UDP performs error checking, but discards erroneous packets</li>
      <li>Open standards and protocols enable different manufacturers and developers to build hardware/software that can communicate with the hardware/software on the rest of the internet</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Internet/Transport Layers:
    <ul>
      <li>Reliability -
        <ul>
          <li>Reliability - Sender gets a receipt back, can be resended as needed</li>
          <li>Transport Control Protocol (TCP)</li>
          <li>Unreliability - Send and forget, User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Purpose “Port” - Number assigned to an application or survice</li>
      <li>3 targets can be addressed using IP:
        <ul>
          <li>Unicast - A specific device, internet wifde access; TCP is used</li>
          <li>Multicast - A group of devices, it is specific range of IP addresses with internet wide access, UDP is used</li>
          <li>Broadcast - All devices, LAN-wide, data stops at the router, and a UDP is used</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Application Layer:
    <ul>
      <li>Web servers - programs running on machines connected to the internet; provides web pages to clients, links to other pages using Uniform Resource Locations (URLs)</li>
      <li>Domain Name Service (DNS) - Applications that translate a human readable url to an IP address, holds a database of mapping of names to IPs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ethernet is the most popular way to access a network</li>
</ul>
