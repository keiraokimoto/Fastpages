    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>1, the program works as intended, calculating values based on the given triangle side length numbers.</td>
      <td>0, the program would not receive a 1 in this category because the written response does not describe the input nor output, nor specify the program’s purpose.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>0, the program does not show that the inputs have been stored in a list.</td>
      <td>1, there are two code segments provided, and there is a list called ‘sideIndex’ in the program as well, with a correct response along with it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>0, the program, nor does the written response, does not explain how the code manages the complexity of the program using lists or otherwise.</td>
      <td>0, same score, different reasoning; the use of the list does not manage the complexity, as it is inaccurate in the written response, which discusses why lists are beneficial to the program.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>1, there is more than one parameter that has an effect on how the prodecure is run, and a procedure is called.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>1, the algorithm being utilized contains sequences, selection, and iteration by manipulating the numbers given to produce results.</td>
      <td>1, same score, same reasoning, but could have added specifics regarding the iterative loop for variable i decreasing by 1 from A, B, or C.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>1, in the written response, two calls are made to the selected procedure which allows the program to create an output from the given inputs.</td>

      <td>4</td>
      <td>1, two program code segments are used, one where different inputs affect the procedure’s output and another where the procedure is called.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>1, the program has multiple steps which are explained in the written portion.</td>
      <td>1, same score, same reasoning, includes sequencing, selection with an if/else statement, and iteration with a repeating loop.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

<p>Essentially, a program would need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lists that log input data</li>
  <li>A loop</li>
  <li>More than one procedure that can be called</li>
  <li>A way to input something that changes what is output by the procedure</li>
</ul>
