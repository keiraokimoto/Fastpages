  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Row Number</th>
      <th>Description of Task</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Explain the program’s purpose, input, output, and how it functions. For example, a program may be used for practical things, like calculating taxes, or for entertainment, such as playing a video.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>The program should show two code segments, one which shows that the data has been stored in a list or another collection type, and that the data in said list is used in the program.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>The program needs to use the list in a way that shows how complexity can be managed. For example, having a list with a thousand items could be managed by using specific calls to find specific parts of the data.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>One procedure with at least one parameter that, when changed, changes the functonality of the procedure. Another code segment shows how the procedure is called.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>An algorithm is used in the code, and it includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. For example, a loop is used as iteration.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>Two calls made to the procedure pass different arguments into the algorithm to execute, and the result of each call is identified.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In summary, to exceed Collegeboard standards, I would need to use loops and different algorithms to create a procedure, and call that procedure. I would also need to use if/else statements, as well as dictionaries, lists, and other data collection/recall devices.</p>
