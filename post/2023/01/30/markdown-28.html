<ul>
  <li>Many groups did projects based around games or food, with one of the presentations being about a Cat Cafe website</li>
  <li>Some groups guided through the project’s basic structure, some included frontend images and some did not</li>
  <li>Most groups did not go into backend details, although mine did</li>
  <li>One other group had a website very similar to my groups, as its subject matter was food</li>
  <li>However, their website was based on finding recipes for people looking for healthy food to eat, whereas ours was more generalized</li>
  <li>Many groups had their website structured or parodied off Cool Math Games, and each person in the group would be responsible for creating one game for the website</li>
  <li>Some groups linked their games together using a leaderboard, which would rank players based off the scores they received in the games they played.</li>
