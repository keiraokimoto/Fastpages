<p>Here are the corrections for my practice MCQ.</p>

    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>12</td>
      <td>My answer was (A), onFloor1 AND callTo2 + onFloor2 AND callTo1, because I thought calling to floor 2 while the elevator is on 1 would get it to move.</td>
      <td>It would be (B), because it uses ‘OR’ instead of ‘AND’, both commans are not required to be correct for the elevator to move.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>14</td>
      <td>My answer was (D), there is no possible value of A that will cause the circuit to be true. I thought that the false input would make the program false.</td>
      <td>The answer would be (A), the input for A would be true, because the input of A would have to be true for the program to function correctly.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>17</td>
      <td>My answers were (A), and (B). I thought (B) would give the same end result as (A), because they both ended at result (true).</td>
      <td>The answer would be (A) and (D), because it marks the results as false, which is the same as the original marking the answer as ‘not true’.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>21</td>
      <td>My answer was (B), 6. I thought that the program would simply add the numbers and make the answer into 6.</td>
      <td>The answer would be (D), an infinite loopm, because the program would actually go in an infinite loop, because the stopping condition cannot be met.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>27</td>
      <td>My answer was (C), because I thought the arrow would move in the right direction if n + 1 was used.</td>
      <td>The answer would have been (D), because the n + 1 should have been added at the end of the cycle to get it to move in the right direction, not before the algorithm.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>28</td>
      <td>My answers were (B) and (C), because I thought these combinations would get the arrow to move in the correct direction.</td>
      <td>My answers should have been (A) and (C), because A would have done much the same as (C), just in a slightly different format.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>30</td>
      <td>My answers were (A) and (C), where (C) was correct and (A) was not. I thought (A) was very similar to (C) in how it functioned, which is why I chose it.</td>
      <td>My answers should have been (B) and (C), because (B) was very similar to (C), but called the function at the very end instead of the beginning.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>43</td>
      <td>My answer was (A), thought I’m not exactly sure why.</td>
      <td>My answer should have been (C), as no simulation can take every single possible factor into account when running.</td>
    </tr>
