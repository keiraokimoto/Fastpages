<p>As the video explained, happiness comes from living in the moment, rather than in the past or the future, and because of this I am going to start doing daily things that make me happy, even if it takes a lot of effort.</p>

<p>What I want to try doing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I’ll try to spend more time with friends and making connections among people, as well as joining communities.</li>
  <li>I’ll always remind the people I love of how much I appreciate them, and foster my relationships and community, and I’ll stop carrying about money that brings me food.</li>
  <li>I’ll focus on the present moment and what I can do now, all the possibiliies and the actions I can make right now to make me happy and live a more fulfilling life, and I won’t focus specifically on the future, only what’s in the present.</li>
  <li>I’ll spend more time resting, so I’m able to have a clearer mind as well</li>
</ul>
