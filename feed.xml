One of the projects I saw from this class was from Noor and her group, where they used a search function that could use emotions (and synonyms of the provided emotion words) to provide a song that went with the given emotion. The program also featured an API that had each song on it, as well as a way for the user to vote for which emotion the song represented. The program would register the users’ votes for each song, for example, a Mitski song being voted as sad. The program would then take this information and match it to an emotion, so it would appear when that emotion was added in the search function.]]></summary></entry></feed>
