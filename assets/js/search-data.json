Connection objects are unique sessions with a datasource. These make it so that each action is a unique instance. | . | Same for cursor object? The object used to make a connection between the code and the SQLite database, and send commands to it. | . | Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object? The objects are used to read, update, delete, and create other items. | . | Is &quot;results&quot; an object? How do you know? . Results has data in it, and different types/attributes. | . | Compare create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations? . Object-oriented programming is better, because it takes less code, and is therefore more efficient. | . | Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User init? SQL insert inserts new data into the database. | . | What does the hacked part do? The &#39;hacked&#39; part of the procedure changes the password, if 2 characters or under, to &#39;hacked&#39;. | . | Explain try/except, when would except occur? Try/Except are much like &#39;if/else&#39;, except they prompt the code to take alternative actions if the specifications are not met, unlike elif statements. | . | What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated? All of the code seems to repeat &#39;connect&#39;, &#39;cursor&#39;, and &#39;results&#39;, because each function is necessary for each code block to run different functions. | . | Is DELETE a dangerous operation? Why? Deleting data makes it unrecoverable, and it cannot be retrieved again. | . | What is the &quot;f&quot; and {uid} do? UID is the user ID, which allows for the user to be identified in the program. | . | Why does the menu repeat? The menu repeats because it links each code cell to each other to create options for the user. | . | Could you refactor this menu? Make it work with a List? Yes, the code can be modified so that each command is part of a list, and it can switch each word to initiate the code sequences if they are part of that list. | . | .",

Machine Learning . From Tutorials Point%20is,a%20consistence%20interface%20in%20Python). Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down.

College Board Practice Quiz: . Corrections: . For the first question, I should have answered B instead of A. I thought that a lossless compression would keep the information the same, equating it to keeping the information secure. The answer is actually B, because lossless compression ensures that the data can be reconstructed. . | For the second question, I got confised and assumed that compression was done for both lossy and lossless files, but it was only done for lossless compressions, not both. . |",

For this question, I answered that ‘Only elements that appear in inputList1 but not in inputList2’, but the answer was ‘Only elements that appear in both inputList1 and inputList2’. This is because the list is searched for elements that appear in both lists, not just one list, which I skipped over by accident. . Question 22 . For this question, I didn’t think either grid would make the arrow move correctly, but I think I missinterpreted the way the arrow moves. The answer would have been A, because the sequence the arrow moves in would make it correct. . Question 29 . I answered with 3 true’s, but the answer should have been 3 false’s. This is because A would have been false, and the false value would have made all 3 print values false. I missinterpreted it to set each value to ‘true’ instead of ‘false’, and ignored that the multiple trues would set it to false. . Question 33 . I chose ‘repeat 4 times’, but the answer would be 2 times instead. I miscounted the rotations, so that’s why my answer was off. . Question 38 . For this question, I thought the correct answer would have (num &lt; 0 ) displaying negative would be the same, and I was correct there, but the order of the function is wrong. (num = 0) would have been in a different position than what I selected, as using the parameter num = 0 would allow for something to be assigned to this variable beforehand. . Question 39 . I thought that adding a line towards the end of the code, and using N, would make the count accurate, but adding a line to count between 6 and 7 (where the movement actually is) would make the count go up correctly. This is because the count should count at the end of the movement, not the end of the turn, because it could count the turn as a movement and make the count go up wrong. . Question 44 . I wasn’t quite sure how the function would exactly look when printed, so I got a bit confused as to how it would actually look printed. B would actually be the right answer. . Questoin 45 . I selected one correct answer, but the answer for A was incorrect. This is because procedral abstraction is supposed to allow a larger block of code to be named, so it is easier to access. . Question 50 . I wasn’t sure which algorithm would run the shortest, so I assumed that at least B would work. However, A and D are the shortest, because they can run more steps for the same size list. .",

Explain. | . Project Addition . If your project has images in it, try to implement an image change that has a purpose. (Ex. An item that has been sold out could become gray scale) | . Pick a programming paradigm and solve some of the following ... . Numpy, manipulating pixels. As opposed to Grey Scale treatment, pick a couple of other types like red scale, green scale, or blue scale. We want you to be manipulating pixels in the image. | Binary and Hexadecimal reports. Convert and produce pixels in binary and Hexadecimal and display. | Compression and Sizing of images. Look for insights into compression Lossy and Lossless. Look at PIL library and see if there are other things that can be done. | There are many effects you can do as well with PIL. Blur the image or write Meta Data on screen, aka Title, Author and Image size. | . Notes, Questions/Answers, and etc. . Lossy - Losing data, data that gets lost from the original and cannot be fully recovered; discards some of the image data to achieve smaller file sizes | Lossless - Some data is lost, restores and recovers data; maintain all the original image data but may result in larger file sizes | Grayscale takes the average of the pixel color values and divides them by 3, making the image gray | The metadata is the information about the image, such as the location the image was taken (if it is a picture) or who the creator is | Object-oriented programming using data structures can also be used to display images (as in, frontend/backend with get, update, pull, delete, etc.), this basically pulls the image data from the backend to the frontend | . Describe some of the meta data and considerations when managing Image files. Describe how these relate to Data Compression ... . File Type, PNG and JPG are two types used in this lab - There are different types of image files such as PNG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF, etc. Each file type has its own compression method, level of quality, and compatibility with different platforms. | Size, height and width, number of pixels - These parameters describe the dimensions and number of pixels in an image. More pixels usually mean higher resolution, but also larger file sizes. Size is the amount of disk space an image takes up. Height and width refer to the number of pixels in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. | Visual perception, lossy compression - Data compression is a technique used to reduce the size of image files. Lossy compression algorithms discard some of the image data to achieve smaller file sizes. Lossless compression algorithms maintain all the original image data but may result in larger file sizes. Visual perception of an image can be influenced by the amount of pixels in it and how it is compressed. | . What are commands you use in terminal to access files? ls, cd (filename) are both commands that can be used in the terminal to access files. . What are the command you use in Windows terminal to access files? cd, dir, and mkdir are some of the commands that can be used in the Windows terminal to access files. . What are some of the major differences? Both are similar, but some of the major differences include the commands themselves, which do different things and access different parts of the device. . Why is path a big deal when working with images? If the path is wrong, the code won&#39;t be able to locate the image, because it can&#39;t find the right pathway. . How does the meta data source and label relate to Unit 5 topics? Metadata can be used to protect user info by hiding things such as IP addresses to protect user privacy. . Look up IPython, describe why this is interesting in Jupyter Notebooks for both Pandas and Images? IPython is a command-line shell that is used for Python, and it provides more features. For notebooks, IPython is used as the default kernal to execute cells. For Pandas, it allows the user to view/manipulate large datasets more easily, and for images it allows for images to be displayed in the program. . Translate first 3 letters of your name to Base64. (See below) S2Vp . Where have you been a consumer of buffering? I have been a consumer of buffering in websites that have lots of popups or parts to them. . From your consumer experience, what effects have you experienced from buffering? It&#39;s much harder to have a good consumer experience when things buffer for too long, as it&#39;s difficult to do things on the site. . How do these effects apply to images? When images don&#39;t load, it&#39;s difficult to see what you&#39;re buying, so you&#39;ll have difficulting deciding what to buy. . Does this code seem like a series of steps are being performed? Yes, multiple parts are needed for a final image to be produced. . Describe Grey Scale algorithm in English or Pseudo code? The grayscale algorithm takes the pixels (the numbers for the RGBs) and divides them so that the saturation decreases. The pixels are then averaged to create the full image. . Describe scale image? What is before and after on pixels in three images? A scale image changes the size of an image. The pixels get removed, so the image quality decreases. . Is scale image a type of compression? If so, line it up with College Board terms described? Yes, it can be related to lossy compression, where some information is lost in the process of compression, but the overall image remains recognizable. . Additionally, review all the imports in these three demos. Create a definition of their purpose, specifically these: . PIL - (Python Imaging Library) A library in Python used for manipulating images. . numpy - (Numerical Python) A Python library that supports large arrays and matrices, and mathmatical functions. . base64 - A binary-to-text encoding scheme that represents binary data in an ASCII string format. . Choose 2 images, one that will more likely result in lossy data compression and one that is more likely to result in lossless data compression. Explain. . Lossy . This image is more likely to result in lossy data compression, beacuse it&#39;s an image that has very little detail in it, and it is very simple. Lossy data compression may result in the image losing some of its detail, and making the image much lower quality as a result. | . . Lossless . This image is more likely to result in lossless data compression, because the image is highly realistic and has many details in it, which is difficult for lossless data compression to keep up with. | . . College Board Practice Quiz: . Corrections: . For the first question, I should have answered B instead of A. I thought that a lossless compression would keep the information the same, equating it to keeping the information secure. The answer is actually B, because lossless compression ensures that the data can be reconstructed. . | For the second question, I got confised and assumed that compression was done for both lossy and lossless files, but it was only done for lossless compressions, not both. . | import base64 name = &quot;Kei&quot; translation = base64.b64encode(name.encode(&#39;utf-8&#39;)).decode(&#39;utf-8&#39;) print(translation) .

Their project was a food-themed website, like my group, so I was curious as to how they created their project differently as compared to my group’s. One of the features on the website was a recipe finder that could find recipes based on the input time of day and the cuisine type. It would pull up a link to a recipe based on that. There was also a quiz function, which allowed the user to select answers on a quiz, then submit them for a score and recipe based off that score. The score could also be input into a leaderboard by the user. . Some of the other projects I saw were from classes like 3D Animation and Ceramics. There were lots of interesting projects, and seeing other students make the projects I did when I was younger in 3D animation was fun. I really enjoyed the ceramic creations, because it’s always fun to see what creative things people can do when they make 3D objects, since making things with clay can be difficult and time consuming. .",

I thought that the false input would make the program false. | The answer would be (A), the input for A would be true, because the input of A would have to be true for the program to function correctly. | . 17 | My answers were (A), and (B). I thought (B) would give the same end result as (A), because they both ended at result (true). | The answer would be (A) and (D), because it marks the results as false, which is the same as the original marking the answer as ‘not true’. | . 21 | My answer was (B), 6. I thought that the program would simply add the numbers and make the answer into 6. | The answer would be (D), an infinite loopm, because the program would actually go in an infinite loop, because the stopping condition cannot be met. | . 27 | My answer was (C), because I thought the arrow would move in the right direction if n + 1 was used. | The answer would have been (D), because the n + 1 should have been added at the end of the cycle to get it to move in the right direction, not before the algorithm. | . 28 | My answers were (B) and (C), because I thought these combinations would get the arrow to move in the correct direction. | My answers should have been (A) and (C), because A would have done much the same as (C), just in a slightly different format. | . 30 | My answers were (A) and (C), where (C) was correct and (A) was not. I thought (A) was very similar to (C) in how it functioned, which is why I chose it. | My answers should have been (B) and (C), because (B) was very similar to (C), but called the function at the very end instead of the beginning. | . 43 | My answer was (A), thought I’m not exactly sure why. | My answer should have been (C), as no simulation can take every single possible factor into account when running. | .",

Number on Rubric Category For My Project . 1 | Program Purpose and Function | The program’s main purpose is to provide recipes to the user for convenience. The program functions as a simple tool for calculating recipe portions as well. | . 2 | Data Abstraction | My project will use an API for recipe storing, as well as lists to categorize and store recipes. | . 3 | Managing Complexity | Lists will be used to store the recipe inputs, and what users may input into the portions. | . 4 | Procedural Abstraction | The addRecipe procedure will be used to add recipes to the program (API), and the procedure portionCalc will be used to calculate how much of each ingredient is needed for the recipe, depending on user input. | . 5 | Algorithm Implementation | My program will call each respective algorithm when commanded to by the buttons on the frontend page. | . 6 | Testing | For testing, I will add recipes and use the calculator as normal, and ensure everything is functioning correctly on the backend. | . Describe portion of Project you will use for Create Performance task. For the project, I will use the portion calculator and recipe adding/deleting system for the Create Performance task. . Describe code plan as it is required for CB. As for the code plan, I intend to implement a backend using flask, and connecting it to the frontend, which will be the website. The backend will house the APIs necessary for the program to pull data from, and store/add data to. On the frontend, the algorithms and procedures will be housed and called through the use if input text boxes and buttons. (Not quite sure how to answer this again, I hope this is alright). . Consider what will be demonstrated in video, aka video plan. As for the video of the program, I would show how the program works. First I would go to the top of the page to show the recipes, then I would click on a recipe to pull it up in the program. After the recipe has been pulled up, I would type in how many portions of the recipe I want, and then submit it to the program to calculate how much of each ingredient is needed. I will also demonstrate the frontend and backend create/delete commands, and explain that the delete command is not accessable in the frontend because I do not want users deleting the recipes on the website. .",

Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? While it does not affect me much personally, there are plenty of cases where people, especially teens, are harmed by the internet because of negative comments on them or their appearance. . 5.2 Blog Post Reflection – Digital Empowerment . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? A person can empower themselves in a digital world by taking steps to protect themselves from possible threats in the digital world. This can mean protecting your information and not posting it on the internet, or by using other services, such as a VPN, to protect your information. . How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. Those who are empowered could help by guiding or protecting those who aren’t. They could also teach those who aren’t empowered to become empowered themselves. For example, I could teach someone how to program or to be more confident in themselves and their programming skills, if they believe they are not good at what they are doing. (Not quite sure if this was the right way to answer, but I tried my best). . Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? Yes, things such as paper and red tape do block digital empowerment. Such barriers can be seen in financial differences, where a person cannot acquire a device or otherwise because of financial constraints. This is both prevelent in Del Norte, and outside of it, as this problem can be seen around the world. . Other Questions . Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit. Ease in finding recipes, calculating proportions, and being able to add recipes are all benefits of my project. . Think of a potential harmful effect of your project. A harmful effect of my project could be that it could make users reliant on it for recipe information. (Not really sure if there are any downsides). . Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year: What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school? The pros of an internet blocker include making sure a person doesn’t see something that is not appropriate for them to see, and keeps them from installing things that could harm a person’s device or other devices at the school. One of the main cons is that these blockers also prevents students from accessing some resources, or installing/using software that they may need, especially in classes such as computer science. . What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide? For yourself or for others. Personally, I’m concerned with how the world will go forward. While those with devices are at an advantage, that often leaves people without access or the ability to purchase devices behind. Since devices are starting to become mandatory for purchases or even for education, it could place those without them at an extreme disadvantage. I’m not too worried about myself, but people without devices struggle a lot, and that is worrisome. . . 5.3 Questions . Write summary/thoughts/conclusions from each of the exercises above. Focus on avoiding Bias in algorithms or code you write. Intentional or Purposeful bias: Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? Virtual assistants may have female voices because women are often seen in a ‘helpful’/’caregiving’ type role, which stereotypically happens to be the role of women. However, this may not have purposeful, as simply choosing the voice that sounded the best would have been the most likely option. This can be a good business move, as it panders to customers when the developers try to choose what they believe would be the most appealing to customers. This may not be corrected, but only if this is truly the case, and the female voice was not chosen because women are seen in service positions only. . Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google) Algorithms on websites such as Amazon are often used to influence customer purchases. For example, Amazon will often show products that are similar to what the user is buying, because they may want to buy similar items. Amazon algorithms are also used to recommend products that other people have bought along with the product you are trying to buy, for the same reason. . Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? If yes or no, justify your conclusion. I think the owner of the computer may think it was intentional, as he seems surprised that it does not recognize him. . How do you think this happened? This may have happened due to oversight in the program’s coding. . Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? Should it be corrected? Yes, it’s harmful and it should be corrected, as it causes a divide in the ways the program can be used. It likely wasn’t intended to be harmful, however, and was likely just an oversight in the program. . What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? More testing and from a wider population would create a much better outcome. . 5.4 Questions . Think of a use case for crowdsourcing in your project. In my project, crowdsourcing could be used in development of recipes, as my site has a feature in which users can add recipes to the database. . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? Crowdsourcing (if speaking in a general sense) could be used to take results for a survey, such as a customer service survey. This could help with improvements to the project as a whole, as information from others can help make the project better. . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? Del Norte crowdsourcing could definitely help with creating more recipes, and improving the site and its functionality. Although crowdsourcing isn’t necessary for the project to function, it does help a lot with creating a good number of recipes that users can access. . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. Random recipe data would be interesting to see, as it would take quite a long time to actually implement a whole recipe into the program, instead of just getting portion numbers. . . 5.5 Questions . When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog. Many licences are very similar, as they cover many of the same things. Patents, copywriting, sharing permissions, private and public use, liability, and warranty are all things covered by these licenses. Licenses can limit how a work is shared and who is able to share it, as well as copyright permissions. . In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic. You are also able to have external deployment. I think licenses are a good thing. As an artist, I know how important it is to have licenses, so someone can protect their work and prevent it from being stolen. . Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update. For our repository, we would probably use a MIT license. This is because it has many of the same permissions as an Apache license, and it can be distributed more readily among collaborators. It is a simple license, which is also highly rated by others, which is why my group chose it. Applying the license was simple; all I did was click which license I wanted, click submit, and it changed the LICENSE.md file for me, for each repos. . 5.6 Questions . Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles. Some PII I’ve seen on other projects include account creation and score tracking from other Compsci projects. . What are your feelings about PII and your personal exposure? PII may be good for business, but it’s also fairly harmful, as having too much of your information out on the internet makes it easier for people to find you. This can be dangerous, as people may wish to harm you. . Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. Good passwords usually have many different characters, 16 or more, and lots of variation in what the characters are. Two-factor authentication is another step that can be used to protect accounts. . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. Symmetric - A private key to encrypts/decrypts an encrypted email Asymmetric - Uses the public key of the recipient to encrypt the message . Provide an example of encryption we used in AWS deployment. In AWS deployment, we used SSH keys to encrypt our websites. . Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques. Phishing schemes such as ads that steal information when clicked are one of the things I’ve been phished by. Other techniques include charity donation phone calls that ask for money, but actually just steal money. .",

In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating an Object. (a data structure).

These are called *Methods when they exist inside a Class definition. | . | An Object is created from the Class/Template. Characteristics of objects ... an Object is an Instance of the Class/Template | there can be many Objects created from the same Class | each Object contains its own Instance Data | the data is setup by the Constructor, this is the &quot;init&quot; method in a Python class | all methods in the Class/Template become part of the Object, methods are accessed using dot notation (object.method()) | . | A Python Class allow for the definition of @ decorators, these allow access to instance data without the use of functions ... @property decorator (aka getter). This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

For example, a program may be used for practical things, like calculating taxes, or for entertainment, such as playing a video. | . 2 | The program should show two code segments, one which shows that the data has been stored in a list or another collection type, and that the data in said list is used in the program. | . 3 | The program needs to use the list in a way that shows how complexity can be managed. For example, having a list with a thousand items could be managed by using specific calls to find specific parts of the data. | . 4 | One procedure with at least one parameter that, when changed, changes the functonality of the procedure. Another code segment shows how the procedure is called. | . 5 | An algorithm is used in the code, and it includes sequencing, selection, and iteration. For example, a loop is used as iteration. | . 6 | Two calls made to the procedure pass different arguments into the algorithm to execute, and the result of each call is identified. | . In summary, to exceed Collegeboard standards, I would need to use loops and different algorithms to create a procedure, and call that procedure.

Homework: Putting it all together(complete only after the random values lesson) . Option 1: Create a python program which generates a random number between 1 and 10, and use turtle to draw a regular polygon with that many sides. As a hint, remember that the total sum of all the angles in a polygon is (the number of sides - 2) * 180. Note: a regular polygon has all sides and angles the same size. Paste a screenshot of the code and the drawing from repl.it . Option 2: use the &quot;datetime&quot; package, and looking up documentation, create a program to generate 2 random dates and find the number of days between . Extra ideas: customize the settings, draw a picture, or something else! . import random import turtle turns = [] t = turtle.Turtle() randNum = random.randint(1, 10) sideLen = input() print (&quot;Randomly generated number:&quot;, randNum) print (&quot;User input side length:&quot;, sideLen) for c in [&#39;red&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;]: t.color(c) turns = 0 for r in range(randNum): t.forward(sideLen) t.left(360/randNum) turns = turns + 1 if turns == randNum: break # So, my turtle doesn&#39;t like me and doesn&#39;t want to work so I just made this &#39;theoretical&#39; code # Essentially, it&#39;s just supposed to generate a random number, which the code marks as the &#39;randNum&#39;, or in other words, the amount of sides # The user can also choose to input a side length # It then prints the side length and number of sides (these are mostly for testing) # The color is randomly selected # Then the turtle will move in accordance to the numbers it&#39;s been dealt # t.forward is the side lengths, and it will move in accordance to the input # t.left is the corners of the shape; since a full circle is 360 degrees, the turtle will turn in a degree that is 360/the randomly generated number so it can have the right amount of sides # If I actually coded this right, the turtle will end at the same place it started and keep looping forever because I didn&#39;t put an end code. But that&#39;s ok my turtle doesn&#39;t work so you won&#39;t ever have to see its eternal suffering, brought on by the stupidity of none other than my lack of sleep and endless desire to drop school completely # Actually I lied, I added the ending code # There&#39;s a turn counter that adds 1 to a neat little index and if that index = the amount of rotations the turtle will stop (hopefully. It can just keep going if it wants to. Goodbye turtle you will be missed.) .

Fill in the blanks please: . Procedure: A named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values; can also be referred as method or function, depending on the language. . Parameters: Input values of a procedure . Arguments: Specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: Separating a program&#39;s functions into independent blocks that work together to allow a program to function . Procedural Abstraction: The name for a process that allows a procedure to be used while only knowing what it does, and not how the program executes the procedure . What are some other names for procedures?: Processes, operations, modules . Why are procedures effective?: Procedures are effective because they allow for code to be more organized while still retaining functionality . Additional Notes: . Procedures interrupt a series of statements and makes the program execute the procedure instead | The original code will be run after the procedure is executed | Procedures may or may not return values (such as numbers or booleans) | Procedures need names to be called (Ex: &#39;convertDecimalToBinary&#39; for a decimal to binary converter) | Procedures allow for additional cells outside of code to be changed without having to change the code itself | . Challenge 1 below: . Add the command that will call the procedure. . decimal = 7 def convertToBinary(decimal): divValue = decimal remainder = 1 finalBin = &#39;&#39; while divValue &gt; 0: remainder = divValue % 2 divValue = (int)(divValue / 2) finalBin = str(remainder) + finalBin return finalBin binary = convertToBinary(decimal) print(binary) . 111 . Challenge 2 below: . Complete the Min and Max procedure in either JavaScript and Python using the instructions from the JavaScript page. (JavaScript will get you a extra 0.1) . numA = 1000 numB = 1 # Repeat the process, this time creating a procedure called findMin, which will print the parameter with a smaller value. def findMin(numA, numB): if numA &gt; numB: return(numB) else: return(numA) # Within the procedure, write the code to determine which of the two parameters, numberA or numberB, is the larger value.

Between 1000 and 1 , 1 is the smaller number. Between 1000 and 1 , 1000 is the bigger number. . // Start by creating a procedure called findMax and set the parameters to numberA and numberB. // Failed javascript attempt ignore this . // Within the procedure, write the code to determine which of the two parameters, numberA or numberB, is the larger value.

Homework/Hacks: . For the hw, you have two options, easy or hard. The easy hack is for a 2.7 + extra work for the full 3. The easy hack is simply creating your own procedure with your own creativity. Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate &quot;APCSP&quot; into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. . x = &#39;APCSP&#39; def charToBinary(x): byteString = bytearray(x,&#39;utf-8&#39;) # result = [] for byteValue in byteString: result.append(format( byteValue, &#39;b&#39;)) print((x), &#39;in binary is:&#39;, (result)) charToBinary(x) # The output shown below is the output you are supposed to get # &#39;&#39;APCSP&#39;&#39; in binary is # [1000001, 1010000, 1000011, 1010011, 1010000] .

Searching algorithms could be done in either intervals or sequences, and certain algorithms could be more efficient than others, with benefits and drawbacks to each. . The Naive Approach . The most intuitively obvious solution to the searching problem is to sequentialy check each successful value in the data structure until either a matching value is found, or the entire structure has been transversed. This thought process could be explained graphically in this example .

This algorithm could also be expressed in code, as shown below. . def sequentialSearch(arr, target): N = len(arr) # Declare N as length of array for i in range(N): # Iterate over the list if arr[i] == target: # Check for match return i # Match found, return index and end function call return -1 # Element not found . Sequential Search - Larger Inputs . Although for selection sort is seemingly fast for smaller inputs, it is clear that it cannot keep up with increasing input sizes. Because sequential search checks every value of the given array, the algorithm&#39;s overall runtime increases &quot;linearly&quot; with the input size. . i.e. Pretend that one check takes one second, and that we are searching for the last element in an array. If the array length is 4, it would take 4 seconds to find the last element, whereas if the array length is 86400 indices long, it would take a whole day to find the element. . Hence, although selection sort is known for its simplicity, it is unfeasible for large inputs . Below, we have created three sorted lists of length 100,1000000,100000000. . import time arr1 = [i for i in range(100)] arr2 = [i for i in range(1000000)] arr3 = [i for i in range(100000000)] . To analyze the sequential search algorithm, we will check for the worst case scenario, where runtime is maximized. This is because when measuring the efficiency of our algorithm, we want to be able to guarantee an upper limit or set amount of time for our program to finish running. To do this, we will attempt to search for the last element in the array . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05602836608886719 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 58.67457389831543 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, sequentialSearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 5162.384986877441 ms . As you can see, as the input list grows larger and larger, the overall runtime of the program increases linearly as well, resulting in a lower scalability for the sequential search algorithm. . Binary Search . Binary search is an efficient way to iterate through a SORTED list to find a requested value. This is done through checking the middle value of a list and checking if the requested value is greater than or less than the middle value. You can start to see why the requested list must be sorted. If the list is not sorted, this logic is flawed, and the binary search algorithm will no longer work. . Unlike the sequential search method, binary search doesn&#39;t check for each successive element until a match is found. In every iteration the algorithm is making a binary decision; if the selected element is larger or smaller than the target. . How exactly does this work? Lets look at these amazing ms paint drawings: . i was too lazy to make a third so ur gonna have to live with 2 :) . This algorithm is extremely efficient as the maximum number of cycles in binary search is equal to log base 2 of the closest, next power of two, to length of list. . If the array is 8 items long, the maximum possible cycles would be 3 (log base 2 of 8 is 3) . If the array is 7 items long, the maximum possible cycles would STILL be 3 as the closest power of 2 to 7 is 8. . If the array is 9 items long, the maximum possible cycles INCREASES to 4, as the closest, next power of two, is 16. . def binarySearch(array, target): # Parameters: array is the given array and target is what we are looking for low = 0 # the starting lower bound high = len(array)-1 # the starting upper bound while high &gt;= low: # we will keep running until we run out of possible subarrays... mid = (high + low) // 2 # define the middle of the list to be the item at the index of the average of the lower and upper bound if array[mid] == target: # if item is in the middle of the list... we found what we are looking for! return mid # therefore, we return the index of where we found the item. elif array[mid] &gt; target: # if item is less than the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the lower half of the list high = mid-1 # therefore, we set the upper bound of the search to be the last item of the lower half else: # if item is neither less than or equal to the middle of the list, this must mean that the item is on the upper half of the list low = mid+1 # therefore, we set the lower bound of the search to be the first item of the upper half # if nothing is returned by the time the while loop ends, that means item MUST be missing from list return False # therefore we tell the user that the requested item was not found . Likewise, we can also take a recursive approach to this problem, note the similarities . def BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, hi): if lo &gt; hi: return False mid = (lo+hi)//2 if arr[mid] == target: return mid elif arr[mid] &gt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, lo, mid-1) elif arr[mid] &lt; target: return BinarySearchRecursion(arr, target, mid+1, hi) . Now, let&#39;s compare the runtime with the same lists we tried with the sequential search algorithm. . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr1)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr1,99)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100 Index: 99 Execution time: 0.05507469177246094 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr2)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr2,999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 1000000 Index: 999999 Execution time: 0.17070770263671875 ms . print(&quot;length of list: &quot;, len(arr3)) s = time.time() print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr3,99999999)) e = time.time() print(&#39;Execution time:&#39;, (e-s)*1000, &#39;ms&#39;) . length of list: 100000000 Index: 99999999 Execution time: 0.06628036499023438 ms . arr4 = [1,4,5,8,10,13,145,1938] print(&quot;Index: &quot;, binarySearch(arr4,17)) .

Challenge . Using JavaScript, create an algorithm that takes in an IP address and a subnet mask and computes the network address. . Overview . As we&#39;ve seen in Unit 4.1, an IP address is a 32 bit number that uniquely identifies each device. (See this for a recap). Something extra is that an IP address also comes with a subnet mask. A subnet mask is also a 32 bit number that identifies what network an IP address in in through a process that uses the bitwise AND. . In ANDing: . 0 + 0 = 0 . 0 + 1 = 0 . 1 + 0 = 0 . 1 + 1 = 1 . The following are the steps to determine the network that an IP address is in given the subnet mask: . Example: IP address: 192.168.0.1 . Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0 . Convert the IP address into binary: 192.168.0.1 -&gt; 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 | Convert the subnet mask into binary: 255.255.255.0 -&gt; 11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 | Do a bitwise AND operation on the binary IP address and subnet mask: | 11000000.10101000.00000000.00000001 +11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000 =11000000.10101000.00000000.00000000 .

In this question, I answered C because I assumed the ‘*’ symbol was referring to putting the result to the power of 5, but the * symbol was actually meant to symbolize multiplication. That is why the answer would be D instead of C. . Question 2 . In this question, I selected B, which says that the code displays nothing if x is negative and false if otherwise. However, the answer would actually be C, because the code tells the variable x to display as nothing if the value of X is negative, because it has no code to tell the value to display as true or false. . Question 11 . For this question, I answered A because I assumed that the ‘repeat until’ command told the code that it needed to iterate through the entire list and compare each element to the others in the list. However, the answer is actually B, because it compares each element to the elements that follow it in the list. This is because it iterates through j/k + 1, which tells the code to do the element after the one that has just looped. . Question 24 . For this question, I answered C but the answer is actually A. This is because I miscalculated the binary and instead of binary 1101 being after 12, I put it before 12. Binary 1101 is supposed to be equivelent to 13, which comes after decimal 12. . Question 32 . In this question, you are supposed to change yourList into the string from myList after the code is run through, but I added both the lists together instead, so the answer would actually be A because this answer simply says that the result of yourList is the same as the data from myList. .",

One of the projects I saw from this class was from Noor and her group, where they used a search function that could use emotions (and synonyms of the provided emotion words) to provide a song that went with the given emotion. The program also featured an API that had each song on it, as well as a way for the user to vote for which emotion the song represented. The program would register the users’ votes for each song, for example, a Mitski song being voted as sad. The program would then take this information and match it to an emotion, so it would appear when that emotion was added in the search function. . I also went to one of my other classes, which is AP Studio Art, to look at the work from my friends in that class. There were no descriptions of the works, but they were displayed on the projecter for the class to see. The images there were progress shots of our works, and it was very interesting to see how the works progressed from bare minimum sketches to fully finished works. .",

OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) - The layers needed to go through to communicate (Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical) | TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) - Establishes a common standard for how to send messages between devices on the internet (Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access) | There are many different protocols, standards, and etc. used in the Application/Transport levels, such as HTTP and DNS (OSI layers 3-7) | Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) manages the development of internet standards via written technical discussions (Requests for Comments, RFC) in an open and collaborative process | Network Access Layer: Pulls the 1’s and 0’s from a wire or radio wave, focused on hardware and protocols that carry 1’s or 0’s | Each NIC has a unique address associated with it (Media Access Control (MAC) Address), used for local hops | . | Network Access/Internet Layer Data Transmission: A packet contains data that is being transmitted as well as metadata containing iniformation used for routing information | . | Internet Layer: Internet was designed to be scalable/able to change in size and scale to meet new demands | Local Area Network (LAN) physically connects, limited by hardware and physics, 1 to hundreds of systems | Intranet - LANs connected by routers within an organization, hundreds to thousands of systems | Autonomous Systems (AS) - Large intranets linked together under the control and policies of major organizations, tens of thousands of systems | The internet, millions of systems made of Autonomous Systems linked together | . | Transport Layer: TCP does error checking and error recovery, so it is slower | UDP performs error checking, but discards erroneous packets | Open standards and protocols enable different manufacturers and developers to build hardware/software that can communicate with the hardware/software on the rest of the internet | . | Internet/Transport Layers: Reliability - Reliability - Sender gets a receipt back, can be resended as needed | Transport Control Protocol (TCP) | Unreliability - Send and forget, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) | . | Purpose “Port” - Number assigned to an application or survice | 3 targets can be addressed using IP: Unicast - A specific device, internet wifde access; TCP is used | Multicast - A group of devices, it is specific range of IP addresses with internet wide access, UDP is used | Broadcast - All devices, LAN-wide, data stops at the router, and a UDP is used | . | . | Application Layer: Web servers - programs running on machines connected to the internet; provides web pages to clients, links to other pages using Uniform Resource Locations (URLs) | Domain Name Service (DNS) - Applications that translate a human readable url to an IP address, holds a database of mapping of names to IPs | . | Ethernet is the most popular way to access a network | .",

            "content": "College Board Program Design . Program Purpose and Function . Our program’s purpose is to provide vocabulary for math (AP Calc and AP Statistics), as well as physics, and provide quizzes to test skills. | The program’s function will be to use dictionaries, inputs, and outputs, to show information. | . Data Abstraction . Dictionaries can be used to store data; data can be backlogged using a ‘console.log’ command (or something similar). | Lists/dictionaries can also be used for search functions (ie; if ‘Statistics’ is searched, a list of words related to ‘Statistics’ will be run, and those items will appear. | . Managing Complexity . Multiple lists can be used to map data, and dictionaries can be used to map certain data to lists | Ex: If a term for the name of a list is searched, it can bring up those terms, and when a term is clicked, a dictionary can direct to different links. | . Procedural Abstraction . We will have a function to administer our quiz that references to a dictionary for the questions and answers, and has a score tracker that when the quiz is finished, outputs different phrases according to how well they did. | We are also considering a functionality in which it will take the type of answers failed and relate it to either outside resources for it or something in our program | . Algorithm Implementation . An algorithm we will have will first ask someone for their current math/science class, then look through dictionary to see the level it would be at in high school (eg. integraded 1a: low, pre-cal: mid, ap calc: high), if the class they state is not given the program will ask if they are taking something outside of school or if they misspelled, then give a chance to clarify. If they are taking something outside of school the program will tell them to try and relate it to one of or school’s courses through provided internet materials. After figuring out their class, our program will ask how much they are struggling, and show a correlated amount of related material to support them. | . Testing . We will institute a reward for quizzes, which will test if there are high scores in the quizzes that the user took, which were stored in a dictionary made, and if there are enough decently high scores they will be redirected to a page that either has a game or links to something enjoyable. | .",

Output to console using the classic programming introduction using a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. . The command or function is console.log() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the console.log command. | The console.log command outputs the parameter to the console, so you can see it in this Jupyter document. | Note, in a Web Application, console.log is used for debugging and is not visible from the browser via HTML. It is used behind the scenes, when using Inspect-&gt;Console from the browser. | . console.log(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of variable . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example defines a variable, then outputs the msg to terminal. . The variable &quot;var msg =&quot; is used to capture the data | The console.log(msg) outputs to console | . var msg = &quot;Hello, World!&quot;; console.log(msg); . Hello, World! . console.log output showing use of a function . This example passes the previously defined variable &quot;msg&quot; to the newly defined &quot;function logIt(output)&quot;. . There are two steps in the code, the definition of the function and the call to the function. &quot;function logIt(output) {}&quot; and everything between curly braces is the definitions of the function. | &quot;logIt(msg)&quot; is the call to the function, this actually activates the function. If you remove this line you will not receive any output to console. | . | Since the variable &quot;msg&quot; was defined in previous cell, it is used a parameter when calling the logMessage function. | . function logIt(output) { console.log(output); } logIt(msg); . Hello, World! . Showing reuse of a function . Now that a function is defined, it can be called from any of the subsequent cell in the Jupyter notebook. A function/method, is a process of creating a procedural abstraction. This a programming practice to promote reuse versus coding the same thing over and over. .

Reuse of logIT Hello, Students! 2022 . Dynamic or Loosely typed language (string, number) . JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you don&#39;t have to specify what type of information will be stored in a variable in advance. The variable type is determined at runtime. This is similar to Python and most interpretive languages. Java which is a compiled language is strongly typed, thus you will see string, integer, double, and object in the source code. In JavaScript, the &quot;typeof&quot; keyword returns the type. . function logItType(output) { console.log(typeof output, &quot;;&quot;, output); } console.log(&quot;Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript&quot;) logItType(&quot;hello&quot;); // String logItType(2020); // Number logItType([1, 2, 3]); // Object is generic for this Array, which similar to Python List . Looking at dynamic nature of types in JavaScript string ; hello number ; 2020 object ; [ 1, 2, 3 ] . Build a Person Function/Class object and JSON . JavaScript functions have special properties and syntax is shown in many ways. In fact, a Class in JavaScript is a special function. Jupyter Notebooks seems to be more friendly to &quot;function&quot; definitions versus &quot;Class&quot;, thus this lesson uses &quot;function&quot; and &quot;prototype&quot; versus &quot;Class&quot;. . Definition of function allows for a collection of data, the &quot;function Person&quot; allows programmer to retain name, github id, and class of designation. | Definition of a prototype allow for the definition of a method associated with the function , the &quot;Person.prototype.toJSON&quot; allows the collection of data to be expressed in a json/string versus JavaScript object. | Instance of a function, the &quot;var leader = new Person(&quot;Eichi Tenshouin&quot;, &quot;jm1021&quot;, 1977)&quot; line makes a variable &quot;leader&quot; which is an object representation of &quot;function Person&quot;. | . // define a function to hold data for a Person function Person(name, age, year, unit) { this.name = name; this.age = age; this.year = year; this.unit = unit; this.role = &quot;&quot;; } // define a setter for role in Person data Person.prototype.setRole = function(role) { this.role = role; } // define a JSON conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Person Person.prototype.toJSON = function() { const obj = {name: this.name, age: this.age, year: this.year, unit: this.unit, role: this.role}; const json = JSON.stringify(obj); return json; } // make a new Person and assign to variable leader var leader = new Person(&quot;Eichi Tenshouin&quot;, &quot;19&quot;, &quot;Graduated&quot;, &quot;fine&quot;); leader.setRole(&quot;Leader&quot;); // output of Object and JSON/string associated with Leader logItType(leader); // object type is easy to work with in JavaScript logItType(leader.toJSON()); // json/string is useful when passing data on internet . object ; Person { name: &#39;Eichi Tenshouin&#39;, age: &#39;19&#39;, year: &#39;Graduated&#39;, unit: &#39;fine&#39;, role: &#39;Leader&#39; } string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Eichi Tenshouin&#34;,&#34;age&#34;:&#34;19&#34;,&#34;year&#34;:&#34;Graduated&#34;,&#34;unit&#34;:&#34;fine&#34;,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Leader&#34;} .

            "content": "Lists and Dictionaries . As a quick review we used variables in the introduction last week. Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary. Show output. | # variable of type string name = &quot;John Doe&quot; print(&quot;name&quot;, name, type(name)) # variable of type integer age = 18 print(&quot;age&quot;, age, type(age)) # variable of type float score = 90.0 print(&quot;score&quot;, score, type(score)) print() # variable of type list (many values in one variable) langs = [&quot;Python&quot;, &quot;JavaScript&quot;, &quot;Java&quot;, &quot;Bash&quot;] print(&quot;langs&quot;, langs, type(langs)) print(&quot;- langs[3]&quot;, langs[3], type(langs[3])) print() # variable of type dictionary (a group of keys and values) person = { &quot;name&quot;: name, &quot;age&quot;: age, &quot;score&quot;: score, &quot;langs&quot;: langs } print(&quot;person&quot;, person, type(person)) print(&#39;- person[&quot;name&quot;]&#39;, person[&quot;name&quot;], type(person[&quot;name&quot;])) . name John Doe &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; age 18 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; score 90.0 &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; langs [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;] &lt;class &#39;list&#39;&gt; - langs[3] Bash &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; person {&#39;name&#39;: &#39;John Doe&#39;, &#39;age&#39;: 18, &#39;score&#39;: 90.0, &#39;langs&#39;: [&#39;Python&#39;, &#39;JavaScript&#39;, &#39;Java&#39;, &#39;Bash&#39;]} &lt;class &#39;dict&#39;&gt; - person[&#34;name&#34;] John Doe &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; . List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being build on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration we will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list | In the example below, the expression appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries. The output looks similar to JSON and we will see this often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Easy peasy ;). | . InfoDb = [] # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Keira&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Okimoto&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;December 21&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;keiraokimoto@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;None&quot;], &quot;Owns_Cheese&quot;: &quot;None&quot;, &quot;Hobbies&quot;: [&quot;Swimming&quot;, &quot;Drawing&quot;, &quot;Playing games&quot;, &quot;Sleeping&quot;], }) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;George&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Washington&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;May 12&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Some cemetary somewhere&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;georgewashington@gmail.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;None&quot;], &quot;Owns_Cheese&quot;: &quot;Parmasan&quot;, &quot;Hobbies&quot;: [&quot;Swimming&quot;, &quot;Horseback riding&quot;, &quot;Hunting&quot;], }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet or preparing it to be stored into a database. Also, it is a great way to exchange data inside of our own programs. . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cheese: &quot;, d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cheese&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Hobbies:&quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Hobbies&quot;])) print() # for loop iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output Keira Okimoto Residence: San Diego Birth Day: December 21 Cars: None Cheese: None Hobbies:Swimming, Drawing, Playing games, Sleeping George Washington Residence: Some cemetary somewhere Birth Day: May 12 Cars: None Cheese: Parmasan Hobbies:Swimming, Horseback riding, Hunting . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output Keira Okimoto Residence: San Diego Birth Day: December 21 Cars: None Cheese: None Hobbies:Swimming, Drawing, Playing games, Sleeping George Washington Residence: Some cemetary somewhere Birth Day: May 12 Cars: None Cheese: Parmasan Hobbies:Swimming, Horseback riding, Hunting . . List Loops . Yeet variable is a list of strings, storing random words. The while loop is used to iterate through the list. Each item in the list is printed in the order added. The index is started at 0 and increment by 1 for each time. . yeet = [&quot;woo&quot;, &quot;wee&quot;, &quot;hee&quot;, &quot;hoo&quot;, &quot;yee&quot;, &quot;yoo&quot;] # while loop contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(yeet): print(yeet[i]) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output woo wee hee hoo yee yoo . For Loop for Lists . For a For Loop, the name of the list is defined and placed into the code. It is defined as d_yeet. . def print_data(d_yeet): print(d_yeet) def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in yeet: print_data(record) for_loop() # Prints data in the d_yeet list . For loop output woo wee hee hoo yee yoo . Reverse Loop for Lists . For the reversed list, the code is defined the same as the original loop, but the reverse command is added to reverse the list. . yeet = [&quot;woo&quot;, &quot;wee&quot;, &quot;hee&quot;, &quot;hoo&quot;, &quot;yee&quot;, &quot;yoo&quot;] #yeet is the variable and it is equal to the string def print_data(d_yeet): print(d_yeet) #&#39;d_yeet&#39; is used to replace the name &#39;yeet&#39; as a definition def reverse_for_loop(): print (&quot;Reverse for loop using reversed n&quot;) for record in reversed(yeet): print_data(record) reverse_for_loop() #reversed command reverses the list def reverse_for_loop_2(): print (&quot;Reverse for loop using range n&quot;) for index in range(len(yeet) -1, -1, -1): print_data(yeet[index ]) reverse_for_loop_2() #reversing the data using a range - &#39;len&#39; = the length. -1 subtracts from the list/makes it reverse . Reverse for loop using reversed yoo yee hoo hee wee woo Reverse for loop using range yoo yee hoo hee wee woo . Recursive Loop for Lists . For a recursive loop with a list, the list name is added to the code. . yeet = [&quot;woo&quot;, &quot;wee&quot;, &quot;hee&quot;, &quot;hoo&quot;, &quot;yee&quot;, &quot;yoo&quot;] # recursive loop essentially continues endlessly until the exit condition is met (which ends at (i + 1)) def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(yeet): record = yeet[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- hide: true - branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .

          "content": "Unit 3 Notes . (I’ve basically copy pasted these from the lessons for ease of access) . Unit 3.1 and 3.2 . Variables and Assignments Notes . I did my best. Ya’ll were speedrunning I am NOT a speedrunner. . Python: . Variables - Name/define; other functions can be done after naming = - Will set something equal to something else, usually a word and number or list, etc Functions can be performed when names are applied (it tells the function to apply to things with the same name) Floats - Decimals that can be used to do math/whatever a function asks for Dictionaries assign keys and values . Javascript: . ‘var xyz’ is a variable assignment (ie; variables can be assigned using var) Booleen is true/false Strings are words, such as ‘let’ Lists - const (name) = . Data Abstraction: . For APs, indexes start at 1 rather than 0 | . Python: . Lists look like: name = [“word”, “word”] | Lists are often used to store data | Lists can also be used to make more lists by using the format: list = [“Strawberry - Fruit”, “Brocolli - Vegetable”] And add: fruit = [] and vegetable = [] Code such as ‘for fruit in list’ can be used to specify what the program is supposed to do with the items under this category in the list | Split [split()] function can be used to split a string into a list | Join [join()] method takes all items in an iterable and joins them into one string; a string must be specified as a seperator | . Javascript: . this.(name) can be used to specify different types of data, (name) can be used to make a category for the data to go in | data can be displayed using var (variable name) = [ new (variable name)(“Name”, “Date”, “Age”), etc etc.]; | A function can be used afterwards to store the data, using: function (function name)(name, (variable name)) name.setRole(“Name”); this.name = name; this.variable name = [Name]; Etc., etc. | . . Unit 3.3 and 3.4 Notes . Vocab: fill in the blanks . The symbol for exponent is ^ The symbol for addition is + The symbol for subtraction is - The symbol for multiplication is * The symbol for division is / The symbol for modulus is % An algorithm is a sequence of steps that accomplishes a specific task . Index is a number representing a position, like a character’s position in a string or a string’s position in a list. Concatenation is when two strings are combined with each other. Length is the amount of items in a string. A substring is a part of a string. . Length - the number of characters/item in a string | Addition, subtraction, and division are all represented by their respective symbols | The only differences are multiplication and exponents (* and ^) | Concatenation (which I cannot spell) is essentially adding 2 strings together | Substrings are parts of strings | The length of a string is the amount of items or numbers in it | ‘Str’ can be used to initialize something for printing | ‘len’ tells the code to consider the entirety of the string’s length . Unit 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 Notes . | Boolean - 2 options (ex: true/false, yes/no, 0/1) | Relational Operator - Operators that can work between any two values of the same type | Logical Operator - Operators that work on operands to produce a single boolean result (such as and or not) | Relational operators go first, then logical . | All programs have conditionals | Conditionals drive selection; they dictate what happens in a program based on whether something is true or false | Usually lots of if/else statements | Algorithm - A set of instructions that accomplish a task | Selection - The process that determines which parts of an algoritm is being executed based on a condition that is true or false | If/else statements change based on what has occured before | Nested Conditionals are like conditionals within conditionals | (Ex: If condtion 1 is met, condition 2 will occur, and if condition 2 occurs, condition 3 can occur) . Unit 3.8 and 3.10 Notes . | Pseudocode Operation | Python Syntax | Description | |:———————–:|—————|:——————————————————————————————————————————:| | aList[i] | aList[i] | Accesses the element of aList at index i | | x ← aList[i] | x = aList(i) | Assigns the element of aList at index i to a variable ‘x’ | | aList[i] ← x | aList(i) = x | Assigns the value of a variable ‘x’ to the element of a List at index i | | aList[i] ← aList[j] | aList[i] = aList[j] | Assigns value of aList[j] to aList[i] | | INSERT(aList, i, value) | aList.insert(i, value) | _value is placed at index i in aList. Any element at an index greater than i will shiftone position to the right. _ | | APPEND(aList, value) | aList.append(value) | value is added as an element to the end of aList and length of aList is increased by 1 | | REMOVE(aList, i) | aList.pop(i)ORaList.remove(value) | _Removes item at index i and any values at indices greater than i shift to the left. Length of aList decreased by 1. _ | . | For Loops - Loops that apply a certain algorithm or function to an entire list of similar things; iterates until told not to/until conditions are met (infinite) | Recursive Loops - Loops that run through the code until reaching a specific break point | While Loops - run until the end of the list (sometimes not in some cases) | . . Unit 3.9 and 3.11 Notes . Binary search: . One of the two searches that can be used | Can only be used with sorted arrays | Can be used in a while loop or recursive function | Uses a min/max value, halves it, and tests to see if the selected half value matches a requirement; if it doesn’t, it takes either a higher or lower value (whichever is closer) to retest | . Sequential search: . Usually slower than a Binary Search, as it goes through every element in a list | Can be used in a while loop or recursive function | Should not be used for long calculations unless you want to explode your computer . Unit 3.12 and 3.13 Notes . | . Procedure: A named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values; can also be referred as method or function, depending on the language. . Parameters: Input values of a procedure . Arguments: Specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called . Modularity: Separating a program’s functions into independent blocks that work together to allow a program to function . Procedural Abstraction: The name for a process that allows a procedure to be used while only knowing what it does, and not how the program executes the procedure . What are some other names for procedures?: Processes, operations, modules . Why are procedures effective?: Procedures are effective because they allow for code to be more organized while still retaining functionality . Additional Notes: . Procedures interrupt a series of statements and makes the program execute the procedure instead | The original code will be run after the procedure is executed | Procedures may or may not return values (such as numbers or booleans) | Procedures need names to be called (Ex: ‘convertDecimalToBinary’ for a decimal to binary converter) | Procedures allow for additional cells outside of code to be changed without having to change the code itself . Unit 3.14 and 3.15 Notes . | . Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick Google search. Methods are used with the following: . Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1. . Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word ‘from’, followed by the package name, then the word ‘import’, then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package’s name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use ‘*’. . To import a method as an easier name, just do what we did first, add the word ‘as’, and write the name you would like to use that package as. . Random values - Randomly generated numbers created using a large set of numbers and a mathematical algorithm | Random values are good for randomizing outputs, which can make sure that there are not as many similar outputs | Random values can also be used for anything including probability, which includes gacha, dice rolls, and more | Really not sure what other notes I can add here | Remember to import random before trying to use a randomizer . Unit 3.16 Notes . | Simulations are used to simplify/modify certain variables | Simulations can contain bias | They can be used to simulate things as tests (ie, launching a bomb) when these actions are too dangerous/impractical to do in the real world | Simulations can also be used to create situations that are too difficult to recreate in the real world (specific weather conditions for example) | Random modules define series of objects that can be generated randomly | Randomization helps simulations, as they can help predict many varying probablilities of a simulation | Abstractions use conditionals to execute one part of the code only when a particular condition is met, repeat looping, simplification, and it does not request input from the user or display output to the user | It is far cheaper to create a simulation than to do said actions in real life . Taught Unit 3.17 and 3.18, no notes for these units. . | .",

Python and API resource definitions are used for RESTful API definitions. Abstraction of Frontend and Backend code, the exchange of standard data format (JSON), and guidelines for exchange (REST) is a technique that saves a lot of time between developers. Learning APIs is a highly recommended step for every developer trying to break into the world of tech. . Covid19: RapidAPI example. This is introducing APIs by accessing something that already exists. RapidAPI shows how many practice RESTful definitions. Almost any data source imagined can be accessed here. | Jokes: An introduction to Python RESTful API libraries. A Python List is used to make a Data Model, but persistence in this technique is limited, each time server is refreshed data is lost. This example is great for learning, but data is considered volatile. | Users: Another RESTful API library example. However, this backend establishes data persistence through the use of a database. This data if properly managed in deployment and migrated when changed can last forever. | . Web API Overview . . A Web API is an application programming interface typically for a web browser. Non-changing or Static Endpoints are used in interacting with the server-side Web APIs. RESTful Web APIs use HTTP methods to access resources via URL parameters, and use JSON for transmitting text between client and server. Server. In these examples, we will be using Python to define REST APIs. Python tools are very popular for building RESTful APIs | REST: Representational State Transfer. A set of guidelines on how to architect a network-connected software system. | Client-server: One guideline is a client and server must be decoupled from each other, allowing each to develop independently. | Layered system: The client may access the resources on the server indirectly through other layers such as a proxy or using authentication. This will be clarified by application and security requirements. | . Client. JavaScript is the frontend language used to consume data from the Python defined REST APIs. Fetch will be used to make HTTP requests, as well as handle HTTP response. There are four basic HTTP methods, they align with Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD). | GET =&gt; Retrieve/Read data | POST =&gt; Create data | PUT =&gt; Update data | DELETE =&gt; Delete data | . REST endpoints will have similarity from application to application. In planning APIs, for a Users system you can anticipate key methods. The Users RESTful APIs would likely contain these endpoints. | GET: /users =&gt; Get a list of users | GET: /users(id) =&gt; Get a single user | POST: /users =&gt; Create a new user | PUT: /users(id) =&gt; Update a user | DELETE: /users(id) =&gt; Delete a user | . Once a RESTful API receives and processes an HTTP request, it will return an HTTP response. Included in this response is an HTTP status code. Common status codes are shown. | 200 =&gt; OK, this response will then have the promise of JSON data | 400 =&gt; Bad Request | 404 =&gt; Not Found | 500 =&gt; Internal Server Error (aka bug) | . . . .",

Lists - An abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once | 2D Lists - A list used to store objects (Ex: List = [“Item 1”, “Item 2”, “Item 3”,]) | . | Dictionaries - An abstract data type that defines an unordered collection of data as a set of key-value pairs (Ex: variable1: A, variable2: B, variable3: C) | . | Class - A template definition of the method s and variable s in a particular kind of object | Algorithms - A specific procedure for solving a well-defined computational problem (Ex: def convertDecToBinary being stated then recalled later in the code using only ‘convertDecToBinary’) | . | Sequence - When your computer will run your code in order, one line at a time from the top to the bottom of your program | Selection - A programming construct where a section of code is run only if a condition is met | Iteration - A process where a set of instructions or structures are repeated in a sequence a specified number of times or until a condition is met (Ex: if x &gt; y: print x, else: (etc., etc.)) | . | Expressions - A computer program statement that evaluates to some value (Ex: * = Multiply, + = Add) | . | Comparison Operators - Operators that compare values and return true or false (Ex: if x &gt; y: print true, else: false) | . | Booleans Expressions and Selection - When one of two options are selected: True or False, Yes or No, etc. (Ex: if x &gt; y: print true, else: end loop) | . | Booleans Expressions and Iteration - When one of two options are selected: True or False, Yes or No, etc. in a repeating loop (Ex: if x &gt; y: print true, else: false) | . | Truth Tables - A table that shows all possible combinations of inputs and, for each combination, the output that the circuit will produce (Ex: alist.append appends, alist.remove removes, etc.) | . | Characters - A display unit of information equivalent to one alphabetic letter or symbol (Ex: A, B, C, = 1, 2, 3 (but binary is probably better)) | . | Strings - An array data structure of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, using some character encoding (Ex: String = [‘Item 1’, ‘Item 2’, ‘Item 3’]) | . | Length - The length of characters a computer’s processor can handle (Ex: 8-bit, 16-bit, etc.) | . | Concatenation - The operation of joining two strings together (Ex: string3 = string1 + string2) | . | Upper - A value that is greater than or equal to every element of a set of data | Lower - A value that is lesser than or equal to every element of a set of data | Traversing Strings - Accessing all the elements of the string one after the other by using the subscript (Ex: if/else statement that evaluates each element in a string) | . | . Python: . If, Elif, Else conditionals - Conditional statements that provide you with the decision making that is required when you want to execute code based on a particular condition (Ex: if x &gt; y: print x, else: (etc., etc.)) | . | Nested Selection Statements - Structures are used when more than one decision must be made before carrying out a task (Ex: if x &gt; y:, if x &gt; 10, print x, else: print y, else: (etc., etc.)) | . | For, While loops with Range, with List - Loops used to repeat a section of code an unknown number of times until a specific condition is met | Combining loops with conditionals to Break - Loops that stop when a specific condition is met, when they would normally continue forever otherwise (Ex: while loop with an if/else print that will end the loop) | . | Continue - A statement that forces the next iteration of the loop to take place, skipping any code in between | Procedural Abstraction - Sections of code that have variable parameters | Python Def procedures - Procedures that allow us to group a block of code under a name, known as a procedure name | Parameters - A special kind of variable used in a function to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the function | Return Values - A value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task (Ex: return example) | . | .",
