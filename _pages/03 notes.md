Here is where I will be storing notes for the year. Will they be organized nicely? Only time will tell.

Compsci Notes:
- Add prefixes to make an order
- Dashes -> don't take them out they mess up the syntax and etc
- Key + value -> gets response
- If 'root' pops up, just uninstall/reinstall
- Adding images: 
   - Drag/drop file into '_images' folder
   - Copy paste image file name into code
   - Pray it works
   - If not, good luck
