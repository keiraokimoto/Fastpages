He creates a computer simulation after much difficulty and suffering to gamble without Niki knowing, because he has an addiction. While his program is almost perfect, it lacks a good way to simulate a real casino, and the randomization is off. What are some things he could add to improve his simulation? (2 answers)\"],\n",
