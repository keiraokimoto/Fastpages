    "Okay, so we've learned a lot of code, and all of you now can boast that you can code at least some basic programs in python. But, what about more advanced stuff? What if there's a more advanced program you don't know how to make? Do you need to make it yourself? Well, not always. \n",

    "Packages allow a python user to import methods from a library, and use the methods in their code. Most libraries come with documentation on the different methods they entail and how to use them, and they can be found with a quick Google search. Methods are used with the following: \n",

    "Some libraries are always installed, such as those with the list methods which we have previously discussed. But others require a special python keyword called import. We will learn different ways to import in Challenge 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we only need to import a single method from the package. We can do that with the word 'from', followed by the package name, then the word 'import', then the method. This will alllow you to use the method without mentioning the package's name, unlike what we did before, however other methods from that package cannot be used. To get the best of both worlds you can use '*'.\n",
