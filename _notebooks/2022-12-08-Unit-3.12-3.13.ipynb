    "Procedure: A named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values; can also be referred as method or function, depending on the language. \n",

    "Parameters: Input values of a procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Arguments: Specify the values of the parameters when a procedure is called\n",

    "Modularity: Separating a program's functions into independent blocks that work together to allow a program to function\n",

    "Procedural Abstraction: The name for a process that allows a procedure to be used while only knowing what it does, and not how the program executes the procedure\n",

    "\n",
    "- Procedures interrupt a series of statements and makes the program execute the procedure instead\n",
    "- The original code will be run after the procedure is executed\n",
    "- Procedures may or may not return values (such as numbers or booleans)\n",
    "- Procedures need names to be called (Ex: 'convertDecimalToBinary' for a decimal to binary converter)\n",
    "- Procedures allow for additional cells outside of code to be changed without having to change the code itself\n"

Since there is a lot of leeway for this one, you must do additional work to get a 3. For the hard hack, below is the start to a character to binary convertor. This is just a template, but the goal is to translate \"APCSP\" into binary. You can delete the existing code if you want. The only contraint is that you must use a procedure. Doing this will get you a 3. "
