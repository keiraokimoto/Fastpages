    "- Look at conn object and cursor object in VSCode debugger. What attributes are in the object?\n",
    "  - The objects are used to read, update, delete, and create other items.\n",
    "- Is \"results\" an object? How do you know?\n",
    "  - Results has data in it, and different types/attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compare create() in both SQL lessons. What is better or worse in the two implementations?\n",
    "  - Object-oriented programming is better, because it takes less code, and is therefore more efficient.\n",
    "- Explain purpose of SQL INSERT. Is this the same as User __init__?\n",
    "  - SQL insert inserts new data into the database. \n",
    "- What does the hacked part do?\n",
    "  - The 'hacked' part of the procedure changes the password, if 2 characters or under, to 'hacked'.\n",
    "- Explain try/except, when would except occur?\n",
    "  - Try/Except are much like 'if/else', except they prompt the code to take alternative actions if the specifications are not met, unlike elif statements.\n",
    "- What code seems to be repeated in each of these examples to point, why is it repeated?\n",
    "  - All of the code seems to repeat 'connect', 'cursor', and 'results', because each function is necessary for each code block to run different functions.\n",
    "- Is DELETE a dangerous operation?  Why?\n",
    "  - Deleting data makes it unrecoverable, and it cannot be retrieved again.\n",
    "- What is the \"f\" and {uid} do?\n",
    "  - UID is the user ID, which allows for the user to be identified in the program.\n",
    "- Why does the menu repeat?\n",
    "  - The menu repeats because it links each code cell to each other to create options for the user.\n",
    "- Could you refactor this menu?  Make it work with a List?\n",
    "  - Yes, the code can be modified so that each command is part of a list, and it can switch each word to initiate the code sequences if they are part of that list."
